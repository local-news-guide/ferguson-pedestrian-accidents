        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">A College Town Where Pedestrians Face Highway Dangers</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Hanceville's identity centers on Wallace State Community College, which brings over 5,000 students to campus each semester. Students walk between parking lots, dorms, and classrooms — often crossing streets that lack adequate crosswalks, signals, or sidewalks. Drivers unfamiliar with campus traffic patterns blow through areas thick with pedestrians.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Compounding the danger, US-31 runs directly through Hanceville carrying high-speed commuter and commercial traffic. The collision between a college town's foot traffic and a federal highway's vehicle speeds creates an environment where devastating pedestrian accidents are far too common.</p>
        <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson has represented pedestrians injured near Wallace State and along the US-31 corridor. We understand how campus-area accidents differ from typical highway crashes, and we build cases that account for Hanceville's unique infrastructure failures.</p>

        <div class="ff-icon-list__icon">1</div>
        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>Campus Area Congestion</h4>
          <p>Wallace State class changes send hundreds of students across streets simultaneously. Drivers unfamiliar with campus schedules don't anticipate sudden waves of pedestrians crossing between parking lots and buildings.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

          <h4>High-Speed US-31 Traffic</h4>
          <p>Vehicles traveling 55+ mph on US-31 enter Hanceville's pedestrian zones with too much speed. The transition from open highway to college town happens too quickly for many drivers to adjust.</p>

          <h4>Distracted Student Drivers</h4>
          <p>A young college population means more phones behind the wheel. Students texting, adjusting music, or using navigation apps miss pedestrians crossing near campus and downtown areas.</p>

          <h4>Inadequate Pedestrian Infrastructure</h4>
          <p>Many areas along the US-31 corridor lack sidewalks, marked crosswalks, or pedestrian signals — forcing people to cross at unmarked locations or walk along narrow road shoulders.</p>

          <h4>Poor Evening Lighting</h4>
          <p>Wallace State evening classes let out after dark. Students walking to parking lots and along residential streets become nearly invisible in areas without adequate street lighting.</p>

          <h4>Parking Lot Conflicts</h4>
          <p>Wallace State's crowded parking lots create constant pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. Drivers backing out of spaces or rushing to find parking before class strike students walking through lots.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>

      <p><strong>Insurance companies target college students.</strong> They'll argue you were distracted by your phone, wearing earbuds, or jaywalking between classes.

    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Hanceville</h2>
    <ol class="ff-steps">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4>
          <p>Get medical help and create an official police report. Hanceville Police Department will respond and document the scene — this report is critical evidence for your case.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Get Medical Treatment</h4>
          <p>Go to Cullman Regional Medical Center or your doctor immediately. Pedestrian impact injuries — head trauma, internal bleeding, spinal injuries — often don't show symptoms for hours. Early documentation links your injuries to the accident.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the location, your injuries, the vehicle, traffic signals, and any lack of crosswalks or sidewalks. Near Wallace State, capture the campus context — parking lot configurations, pedestrian traffic patterns, and lighting conditions.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements they can use against you under contributory negligence. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">I was hit near Wallace State campus. Can I still file a claim if I was crossing outside a crosswalk?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes &mdash; but Alabama's contributory negligence law makes it complicated. Insurance companies will argue that crossing outside a marked crosswalk makes you partially at fault, which could bar your entire claim. However, in areas like Wallace State where there are no marked crosswalks or pedestrian signals, drivers still owe a duty of care. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson builds cases that prove the driver's negligence was the cause of the accident, not your walking path.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What injuries are most common in Hanceville pedestrian accidents?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Pedestrian accidents near Wallace State and along US-31 commonly result in traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, broken bones (especially legs, hips, and pelvis), internal organ damage, road rash and soft tissue injuries, and concussions. The severity depends on vehicle speed &mdash; US-31 highway-speed impacts tend to be far more catastrophic than lower-speed parking lot incidents.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">I'm a college student with no savings. Can I afford a pedestrian accident lawyer?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Absolutely. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson works on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong> &mdash; you pay nothing upfront and nothing at all unless we win your case. This is especially important for college students who may not have resources to pay hourly legal fees. Our consultation is free, and our fee comes from a percentage of the compensation we recover for you.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does contributory negligence apply to pedestrian accidents near a college campus?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's contributory negligence rule means insurance companies will try to blame you for wearing earbuds, looking at your phone, crossing outside marked areas, or even walking at night near campus. If they succeed in proving any fault on your part, your claim could be denied entirely. An experienced attorney knows how to counter these arguments by proving the driver had the greater duty of care and failed to meet it.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What if the driver who hit me in Hanceville was uninsured or fled the scene?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>You may still recover compensation through your own <strong>uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage</strong>. Alabama law requires insurance companies to offer UM/UIM coverage, and many drivers carry it without realizing it. Hit-and-run drivers also face criminal charges under Alabama law. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson investigates all potential sources of recovery.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident. Missing this deadline means losing your right to file a lawsuit. Because building a strong case requires time to preserve evidence and document injuries, we recommend contacting a lawyer as soon as possible after your accident.</p>
