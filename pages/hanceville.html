                    <h2>Pedestrian Safety Challenges in Hanceville</h2>
                    <p>Hanceville faces unique pedestrian safety challenges as a college town intersected by a major highway. With Wallace State Community College bringing thousands of students to campus daily, the areas surrounding the college see constant foot traffic as students walk between parking lots, residence halls, and classroom buildings. Many of these students are young and may not anticipate the dangers posed by distracted or speeding drivers.</p>
                    <p>The US-31 corridor compounds these risks by bringing high-speed traffic directly through town. Drivers unfamiliar with local conditions may not expect heavy pedestrian activity in what appears to be a rural highway setting. When college students, local residents, and through-traffic converge, the potential for serious pedestrian accidents increases dramatically. If you or a loved one has been injured as a pedestrian in Hanceville, Ferguson & Ferguson can help you pursue the compensation you deserve.</p>

                    <h3>Campus Area Congestion</h3>
                    <p>The Wallace State campus area sees heavy pedestrian traffic during class changes, with students crossing streets between parking lots and buildings. Drivers unfamiliar with campus traffic patterns may not anticipate sudden pedestrian crossings, particularly during peak hours when hundreds of students are moving between classes.</p>

                    <h3>High-Speed Highway Traffic</h3>
                    <p>US-31 runs directly through Hanceville, bringing highway-speed traffic into close proximity with pedestrian areas. Drivers traveling at 55+ mph may have difficulty slowing for unexpected pedestrians, particularly near businesses and intersections where people cross this major corridor.</p>

                    <h3>Distracted Drivers</h3>
                    <p>With a young college population and increasing phone usage, distracted driving is a significant concern in Hanceville. Students texting while driving, adjusting music, or using navigation apps may fail to notice pedestrians crossing near campus or in downtown areas, leading to preventable collisions.</p>

                    <h3>Poor Pedestrian Infrastructure</h3>
                    <p>Many areas of Hanceville, particularly along the US-31 corridor, lack adequate sidewalks, crosswalks, or pedestrian signals. This forces pedestrians to walk along roadways or cross at unmarked locations, significantly increasing their exposure to vehicle traffic and the risk of being struck.</p>

                    <h3>Limited Lighting</h3>
                    <p>Evening classes at Wallace State and night-time activities mean students and residents are often walking after dark. Inadequate street lighting near campus and along residential streets makes it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians, particularly those wearing dark clothing or crossing at unmarked locations.</p>

                    <h3>Parking Lot Accidents</h3>
                    <p>Wallace State's parking lots see frequent pedestrian-vehicle conflicts as students walk to and from their cars. Drivers backing out of spaces, rushing to find parking before class, or distracted by their phones may strike pedestrians walking through the lot. These low-speed collisions can still cause serious injuries.</p>

                <div class="law-text">
                    <h2>Alabama Pedestrian Accident Laws</h2>
                    <p>Alabama's pedestrian accident laws significantly impact your ability to recover compensation after being struck by a vehicle. Understanding these legal principles is essential to protecting your rights.</p>

                    <h3>Contributory Negligence Rule</h3>
                    <p>Alabama follows the harsh doctrine of contributory negligence, which bars recovery if you are found even 1% at fault for the accident. This means insurance companies will aggressively investigate whether you were jaywalking, crossed against a signal, or failed to yield right-of-way. Even minor pedestrian errors can be used to deny your entire claim. This makes experienced legal representation critical in Hanceville pedestrian cases.</p>

                    <h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
                    <p>You have two years from the date of the accident to file a personal injury lawsuit in Alabama. Missing this deadline means losing your right to compensation forever, regardless of how strong your case may be. For wrongful death claims, the family has two years from the date of death. Given the complexity of pedestrian cases and Alabama's contributory negligence rule, it's important to consult an attorney immediately rather than waiting.</p>

                    <h3>Right-of-Way Laws</h3>
                    <p>Alabama law grants pedestrians right-of-way in marked crosswalks and at intersections, but requires pedestrians to yield to vehicles when crossing outside these designated areas. Drivers must exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians, even when the pedestrian may be violating traffic laws. These competing obligations create gray areas that insurance companies exploit to deny claims.</p>

                    <h3>Comparative Evidence</h3>
                    <p>Because of contributory negligence, evidence is everything in Alabama pedestrian cases. Witness statements, traffic camera footage, phone records proving distraction, and accident reconstruction can mean the difference between full compensation and nothing. Ferguson & Ferguson conducts thorough investigations to gather this critical evidence before it disappears.</p>

                        <h4>Why Legal Help Matters</h4>
                        <p>With contributory negligence, insurance companies will blame you for any aspect of the accident they can. Without an attorney, you may unknowingly admit fault or fail to gather evidence that proves the driver's negligence. Don't give a recorded statement or accept a settlement without legal advice.</p>

                <h2>What To Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Hanceville</h2>
                <p>Taking the right steps immediately after an accident protects both your health and your legal rights</p>
            </div>
            <div class="steps-list">
                <div class="step-item">

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Get Medical Attention</h3>
                        <p>Call 911 immediately and request an ambulance. Even if you don't think you're seriously injured, adrenaline can mask symptoms of internal injuries, head trauma, or fractures. Being transported to Cullman Regional Medical Center creates an official medical record linking your injuries to the accident—critical evidence if the driver later denies fault. Hanceville Police will also document the scene, and their accident report can be essential to your claim.</p>

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Document the Scene</h3>
                        <p>If you're physically able, take photos of the accident location, vehicle damage, your injuries, skid marks, traffic signals, and any lack of crosswalks or sidewalks. Near Wallace State, photograph the campus context—parking lot configurations, heavy pedestrian traffic, or poor lighting. Get names and phone numbers of any witnesses, especially fellow students or faculty who saw what happened. This evidence disappears quickly, so collect it while still at the scene.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="step-item">

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Exchange Information</h3>
                        <p>Obtain the driver's name, phone number, insurance information, and license plate number. If the accident occurred in a parking lot or on campus property, note the property owner as well. Do not discuss fault or apologize—Alabama's contributory negligence rule means any admission can destroy your case. Stick to exchanging factual information and let the police report document what happened.</p>

                        <h3>Preserve Evidence</h3>
                        <p>Keep the clothes you were wearing, as they may show impact points or vehicle paint transfer. Don't repair or dispose of any damaged personal items like backpacks, phones, or laptops. If you were struck near Wallace State, your student ID records or class schedule can prove you had a legitimate reason to be crossing at that location and time—important context when insurance companies suggest you were jaywalking or crossing recklessly.</p>

                        <h3>Contact an Attorney</h3>
                        <p>Call Ferguson & Ferguson before speaking to any insurance adjuster. Insurance companies will contact you quickly and press for a recorded statement while you're injured and vulnerable. Their goal is to get you to accept blame or minimize your injuries. We offer free consultations and handle all communication with insurers while you focus on recovery. With Alabama's strict contributory negligence rule, having an attorney from day one can be the difference between fair compensation and nothing.</p>
