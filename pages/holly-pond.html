        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">A Small-Town Grid Anchored by a Four-Way Highway Intersection</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Holly Pond is a town of approximately 800 people in eastern Cullman County, built around the intersection of US-278 and AL-91. This four-way junction is the town's center of gravity &mdash; Holly Pond High School, churches, the post office, and local businesses all cluster around it. But US-278 carries highway-speed commuter traffic between Cullman and Arab, and the intersection was designed to move vehicles, not protect pedestrians.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Holly Pond's small-town grid means pedestrian activity is concentrated in a tight area where walking is the natural way to move between the school, downtown businesses, and residences. Students walk to Holly Pond High School along road shoulders, churchgoers cross the highway on Sunday mornings, and residents walk the town grid daily &mdash; all without sidewalks, crosswalks, or pedestrian signals.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows how Holly Pond's intersection geometry, school zone, and small-town walking culture create pedestrian dangers that outsiders overlook.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes Holly Pond, the US-278 and AL-91 corridors, Holly Pond High School zone, and all surrounding areas in eastern Cullman County. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 50 minutes northwest via I-65.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Understanding Holly Pond's Street-Level Risk</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Every pedestrian accident in Holly Pond happens at a specific place, shaped by the town's intersection-centered layout. Understanding the street grid helps explain why certain locations produce more collisions.</p>

          <h4>US-278 / AL-91 Four-Way Intersection &mdash; The Town's Epicenter</h4>
          <p>The four-way intersection of US-278 and AL-91 is Holly Pond's most critical pedestrian conflict zone. Traffic from two state routes converges at the town center, with vehicles approaching from four directions. Turning movements are complex, and drivers focus on vehicle traffic gaps rather than scanning for pedestrians. The intersection lacks pedestrian signals, has limited crosswalk markings, and sight lines are restricted by adjacent buildings and parked vehicles.</p>

          <h4>Holly Pond Town Grid &mdash; Walking Culture Meets Highway Traffic</h4>
          <p>Holly Pond's compact grid of residential streets connects to the US-278 corridor in multiple locations. Residents walking between homes, the post office, churches, and local businesses use these grid streets naturally &mdash; but every connection to US-278 creates a conflict point where walking-speed pedestrians meet highway-speed vehicles. None of these connections have crosswalks or traffic controls.</p>

          <h4>Holly Pond High School &mdash; Students on Highway Shoulders</h4>
          <p>Holly Pond High School generates daily surges of student foot traffic along the US-278 corridor. Students walk to and from school on road shoulders, cross the highway to reach parking areas, and wait at bus stops without protected infrastructure. The school zone speed reduction exists but is routinely violated by commuters who treat US-278 as a through-route.</p>

          <h4>Church and Community Gathering Points &mdash; Periodic Pedestrian Surges</h4>
          <p>Holly Pond's churches line the US-278 corridor and town grid. Sunday mornings, Wednesday evenings, and community events produce predictable surges in pedestrian traffic as congregants walk to services and cross the highway. These events create high concentrations of pedestrians &mdash; including elderly residents and children &mdash; in areas with zero pedestrian infrastructure.</p>

          <h4>US-278 East-West Corridor &mdash; The Speed-Through Problem</h4>
          <p>US-278 carries commuter and commercial traffic between Cullman and Arab at highway speed. Many drivers treat Holly Pond as a speed bump on their commute rather than a community where people live and walk. The speed differential between through-traffic and pedestrian movement is the fundamental hazard &mdash; a 55 mph vehicle and a 3 mph pedestrian create a physics problem with no good outcome.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Holly Pond Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Holly Pond pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters commonly argue that the pedestrian jaywalked, should have crossed at the four-way intersection rather than mid-block, or should have waited for all traffic to clear. They ignore that Holly Pond's intersection lacks pedestrian signals, most streets have no crosswalks, and walking on the shoulder is a necessity when no sidewalks exist.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Small-town walking patterns are not negligence.</strong> Holly Pond residents have walked this town grid for generations. The absence of crosswalks and pedestrian signals is an infrastructure failure, not evidence that pedestrians are at fault for being on foot. Randy Ferguson uses intersection geometry, pedestrian traffic patterns, and infrastructure surveys to dismantle insurance company arguments that blame victims for walking in their own community.</p>

For accidents on US-278, AL-91, or outside town limits, the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a> or dial 911. An official accident report is critical evidence.</p>

          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Highway-speed pedestrian impacts cause traumatic brain injuries, spinal damage, and internal bleeding that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records become key evidence.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the intersection, road conditions, the lack of crosswalks and pedestrian signals, your injuries, and the vehicle. Note sight-line obstructions from buildings and parked vehicles near the four-way intersection. If the school zone was active, document signage and flashing lights.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. Their goal is to get you on record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Holly Pond's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Holly Pond's location in eastern Cullman County &mdash; on the plateau at approximately 850 feet elevation &mdash; produces weather conditions that interact with the town's intersection-centered layout to create seasonal pedestrian dangers.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

          <h4>Winter Sun Angles on US-278 &mdash; November Through February</h4>
          <p>US-278 runs roughly east-west through Holly Pond. During winter months, the sun hangs at a low angle that aligns directly with the roadway during morning and afternoon commute hours. Drivers heading east in the morning and west in the afternoon face severe windshield glare at the exact hours when school zone and intersection pedestrian traffic is highest. The US-278/AL-91 intersection becomes a glare trap where turning drivers literally cannot see pedestrians in the crossroads.</p>

          <h4>Wind-Driven Rain &mdash; March Through May and October Through November</h4>
          <p>Holly Pond's plateau elevation exposes the town grid to wind-driven rain during spring and fall storm systems. Pedestrians walking on shoulders lean into wind and rain, reducing their awareness of approaching traffic. Drivers face rain-streaked windshields and reduced visibility. The combination produces conditions where neither party can see the other clearly until dangerously close.</p>

          <h4>Morning Fog in Low Areas &mdash; October Through March</h4>
          <p>While Holly Pond sits on a plateau, the surrounding terrain produces pockets of morning fog that drift through the town grid during cool-weather months. Fog settling near the US-278/AL-91 intersection reduces visibility for both drivers and pedestrians. Students walking to school during early morning fog are particularly vulnerable, as their smaller profiles are harder to detect in limited visibility.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Who responds to pedestrian accidents in Holly Pond?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Holly Pond has a small town police department that may respond within town limits. For accidents on US-278, AL-91, or outside town limits, the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. Alabama State Troopers may also respond to state highway accidents. Request an official accident report &mdash; it is critical evidence for your claim.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How dangerous is the US-278/AL-91 intersection for pedestrians?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>The US-278/AL-91 four-way intersection is Holly Pond's most dangerous pedestrian location. It handles traffic from two state routes converging at the town center, with vehicles approaching from four directions. Turning movements are complex, and drivers focus on vehicle traffic gaps rather than scanning for pedestrians. The intersection has no pedestrian signals, limited crosswalk markings, and poor sight lines from adjacent buildings.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Holly Pond pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. If the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim can be denied. In Holly Pond, insurance adjusters commonly argue pedestrians should have crossed at a different location or waited for all traffic to clear. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments using intersection geometry, traffic patterns, and infrastructure evidence.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">I was struck near Holly Pond High School. Does the school zone affect my case?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Drivers owe a <strong>heightened duty of care</strong> in school zones. If the driver was speeding, distracted, or ignoring school zone signs near Holly Pond High School, that strengthens your claim significantly. Students walking along US-278 to reach school face particular danger from commuters who treat the highway as a through-route.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident (Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38). However, evidence deteriorates quickly &mdash; skid marks fade, surveillance footage gets overwritten, and witnesses move away. Contact an attorney as soon as possible after the accident.</p>

        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
