                    <h2>Pedestrian Safety in a Small Town on a Major Highway</h2>
                    <p>Holly Pond sits along Highway 31, a high-speed corridor that carries heavy through traffic between Cullman and points north. For a town of 800 residents, that creates a dangerous paradox: a walkable, close-knit community intersected by a road where drivers routinely exceed 55 mph.</p>
                    <p>Add school zones near Holly Pond High School, limited crosswalks through the town center, and pedestrians forced onto narrow shoulders, and you have a recipe for serious accidents. When those accidents happen, victims face catastrophic injuries—broken bones, traumatic brain injuries, spinal damage, or worse.</p>
                    <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents Holly Pond pedestrians injured by negligent drivers. We investigate the crash, identify all liable parties, and fight for full compensation.</p>

                <h3>Contributory Negligence Rule</h3>
                <p>Alabama follows a harsh contributory negligence rule: if you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you cannot recover damages. Insurance companies exploit this by claiming the pedestrian "darted out" or was "jaywalking." We gather evidence—witness statements, surveillance video, accident reconstructions—to prove the driver was 100% at fault.</p>

                    <li><strong>Ala. Code § 32-5A-220:</strong> Drivers must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks.</li>

                    <li><strong>Ala. Code § 32-5A-215:</strong> Pedestrians must use crosswalks where provided, but drivers still owe a duty of care even when pedestrians cross outside marked areas.</li>

            <div class="ff-steps">
                <div>
                    <h3>1. Get Medical Help</h3>
                    <p>Call 911 immediately. Even if you feel "okay," adrenaline can mask serious injuries. Request transport to Cullman Regional Medical Center or another equipped facility. Internal injuries, head trauma, and fractures may not show symptoms for hours.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>2. Report to Holly Pond VFD or Cullman County Sheriff</h3>
                    <p>If you're able, ensure law enforcement responds and files a crash report. Holly Pond Volunteer Fire Department often assists at accident scenes, and Cullman County Sheriff's Office has jurisdiction. Get the report number and officer's name.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>3. Document Everything</h3>
                    <p>Take photos of your injuries, the crash scene, vehicle damage, skid marks, and road conditions. Get contact information from witnesses. If the driver flees, note the vehicle's make, model, color, and license plate if possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>4. Preserve Evidence</h3>
                    <p>Keep the clothing and shoes you were wearing. Take photos of bruises and wounds as they develop over the next few days. Save all medical records, bills, and prescription receipts.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>5. Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson Before Talking to Insurance</h3>
                    <p>Insurance adjusters will contact you quickly, hoping to record a statement they can use against you. Do not give a recorded statement, sign any releases, or accept a settlement without consulting an attorney. Call us first at <a href="tel:2565555555">(256) 555-5555</a>.</p>
