  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Holly Pond Pedestrian Accidents</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-3">A Walking Town Bisected by a Federal Highway</h2>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Holly Pond sits directly on Highway 31, one of Alabama's busiest north-south corridors. The town's commercial center, schools, and churches line the highway, meaning residents must interact with high-speed through-traffic for nearly every daily errand.</p>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Highway 31 was not designed for pedestrians. Many drivers maintain highway velocity through town, giving them little time to react to pedestrians at driveways, intersections, or walking along narrow shoulders. Holly Pond High School adds another layer of concern with students creating periodic surges in foot traffic.</p>
  <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents Holly Pond pedestrians injured by negligent drivers on Highway 31 and surrounding roads. We know the specific dangers of this corridor.</p>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Alabama Pedestrian Law</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Know Your Rights as a Pedestrian in Alabama</h2>
  <div class="ff-law-box"><h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3><ul>
    <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
    <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
    <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
    <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
    <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
    <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
    <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
    <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
    <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
    <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="ff-callout"><p><strong>Speed kills pedestrians.</strong> A pedestrian struck at 55 mph has less than a 10% chance of survival. At 25 mph, survival rates exceed 90%. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson holds speeding drivers fully accountable.</p></div>

  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Holly Pond</h2>
  <ol class="ff-steps">
    <li><div><h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4><p>Call 911. Holly Pond Volunteer Fire and Cullman County EMS will respond. Alabama State Troopers or the Sheriff will document the scene.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4><p>Go to Cullman Regional Medical Center immediately. Highway-speed pedestrian impacts cause life-threatening injuries requiring immediate evaluation.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Document Everything</h4><p>Photograph the scene, your injuries, the vehicle, highway conditions, and any lack of crosswalks or pedestrian signals. Get witness contact information.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4><p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements to twist against you under Alabama's contributory negligence rule. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson</h4><p>The sooner we are involved, the better we can preserve evidence and protect your claim. Free consultation &mdash; call (256) 350-7200.</p></div></li>

<section id="faq" class="ff-section"><div class="ff-container"><div class="ff-text-center ff-mb-5"><span class="ff-eyebrow">Frequently Asked Questions</span><h2>Pedestrian Accident FAQ &mdash; Holly Pond, Alabama</h2></div>
  <div class="ff-faq">
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How dangerous is Highway 31 for pedestrians in Holly Pond?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Extremely dangerous. Highway 31 bisects Holly Pond, carrying vehicles at 55+ mph past homes, businesses, schools, and churches. With no sidewalks, limited crosswalks, and poor lighting, pedestrians have almost no protection. The speed differential between highway traffic and people on foot means that every pedestrian accident on this corridor is potentially life-threatening.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">I was hit near Holly Pond High School. Does the school zone matter for my case?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Drivers owe a <strong>heightened duty of care</strong> in school zones. If the driver was speeding, ignoring school zone signs, or distracted near Holly Pond High School, that strengthens your claim significantly. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson builds cases that emphasize the driver's failure to meet this higher standard.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was walking on Highway 31's shoulder and was struck?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Absolutely. Walking on the road shoulder is a necessity when there are no sidewalks. Alabama law requires drivers to exercise due care toward pedestrians on any roadway, including shoulders. Insurance companies will try to blame you for being on the road, but Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to defeat this argument.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What injuries are common in Highway 31 pedestrian accidents?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Highway-speed pedestrian impacts cause severe injuries: traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, crush injuries, and amputations. A pedestrian struck at 55 mph has less than a 10% chance of survival. Survivors often face months or years of rehabilitation.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a claim after a pedestrian accident in Holly Pond?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Alabama's statute of limitations is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident. However, evidence deteriorates quickly &mdash; skid marks fade, surveillance footage gets overwritten, and witnesses move away. Contact an attorney as soon as possible to preserve the strongest case.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson charge anything for a consultation?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>No. Consultations are always free. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, meaning you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no financial risk to you.</p></div></details>
