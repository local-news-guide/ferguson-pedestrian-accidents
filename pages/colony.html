        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Colony's Tree-Canopied Roads Hide Pedestrians in Plain Sight</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Colony is a tight-knit community of roughly 350 people in Cullman County where CR-222 serves as the main artery through a historic residential area. Homes sit close to the road with short setbacks. Residents walk between neighbors' houses, walk dogs along the road, jog for exercise, and gather at Colony's churches &mdash; all on roads that offer zero pedestrian protection.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">What makes Colony uniquely dangerous is its dense tree canopy. Mature hardwoods lining CR-222 and surrounding county roads create alternating patterns of bright sunlight and deep shade that temporarily blind drivers &mdash; a "strobe" effect that makes pedestrians appear and disappear from a driver's field of vision. A pedestrian clearly visible in a sunlit patch becomes invisible in the next shadow zone, just ten feet ahead.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over 34 years. He understands Colony's unique visibility challenges and builds cases that prove driver negligence &mdash; not the pedestrian's presence on a shared road &mdash; caused the accident.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes the community of Colony, surrounding areas along CR-222, and all 12 communities in our Cullman County service network. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 50 minutes northwest via I-65.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Understanding Colony's Street-Level Risk</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Colony's pedestrian accidents are shaped by a specific combination of narrow roads, dense canopy, and a walking culture that predates the automobile. Understanding the topography explains why this small community produces pedestrian injuries.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

          <h4>CR-222 Corridor &mdash; Colony's Main Artery</h4>
          <p>CR-222 is the primary road through Colony, a narrow two-lane county road that lacks center line markings in some sections. Drivers use it as a shortcut between larger communities, treating it as open road despite homes lining both sides. Pedestrians walking on CR-222 have no shoulder, no sidewalk, and no escape route when vehicles approach at speed.</p>

          <h4>Historic Residential Grid &mdash; Short Setbacks, Direct Road Access</h4>
          <p>Colony's homes were built close to the road in an era before modern traffic. Front doors open just feet from the travel lane. Residents walk from their homes directly into the road to check mail, visit neighbors, or reach parked vehicles. There is no buffer zone, no sidewalk, and no visual transition to warn drivers they're entering a residential area.</p>

          <h4>Tree Canopy "Strobe" Effect &mdash; Alternating Blindness</h4>
          <p>Dense hardwood canopy along CR-222 creates alternating zones of bright sunlight and deep shadow. Drivers moving through these zones experience a "strobe" effect that temporarily disrupts visual adaptation. A pedestrian visible in a sunlit patch disappears when the driver enters the next shadow zone, only to reappear when it's too late to stop. This effect is worst during morning and evening hours when sun angle is lowest.</p>

          <h4>Church and Community Gathering Points</h4>
          <p>Colony's churches along CR-222 generate periodic surges of pedestrian activity during Sunday services, Wednesday evening gatherings, and community events. Families walk to church along road shoulders. After services, groups of pedestrians &mdash; including children and elderly members &mdash; walk along the road simultaneously, creating unexpected foot traffic for through-drivers.</p>

          <p>Residents on Colony's dead-end county roads must walk to CR-222 to reach neighbors, church, or any community destination. These roads have no pedestrian connections, no lighting, and terminate at CR-222 without crosswalks or warning signs. Pedestrians emerging from dead-end roads onto CR-222 face approaching traffic with no visibility assistance.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Colony Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Colony pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters routinely argue that the pedestrian was walking on a road without a sidewalk, failed to wear reflective clothing, was walking a dog that extended into the travel lane, or was walking on the wrong side of the road. In a community where walking on the road is the only option, these arguments blame victims for Colony's complete lack of pedestrian infrastructure.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Walking in Colony is a necessity, not negligence.</strong> When no sidewalks exist, Alabama law (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215) cannot require you to use one. Randy Ferguson uses infrastructure surveys, canopy-shade analysis, and road geometry data to prove that Colony's roads gave you no safe alternative &mdash; and that the driver's failure to adjust speed and attention for known residential conditions caused the accident.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Colony</h2>
    <ol class="ff-steps">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call 911 &mdash; Cullman County Sheriff</h4>
          <p>Colony has no city police department. The <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds to all accidents in the Colony area &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. Rural response times may be longer than in Cullman. An official accident report is critical evidence for your claim.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) &mdash; approximately 20 minutes from Colony. Pedestrian impacts commonly cause traumatic brain injuries, internal bleeding, and spinal injuries that may not show symptoms for hours.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the road, tree canopy and shadow patterns, lack of shoulders and sidewalks, the vehicle, your injuries, and any sight-line obstructions. Note the time, weather, and lighting conditions. Document the canopy's sun/shade pattern at the time of the accident.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. Their goal is to get you on the record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Colony's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Colony's dense tree canopy and rural terrain produce weather and visibility conditions that directly compound the dangers pedestrians already face on roads with no infrastructure.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

          <h4>Canopy-Filtered Light &mdash; Year-Round Visibility Hazard</h4>
          <p>Dense tree canopy along CR-222 creates "strobe" light patterns &mdash; alternating bright sun and deep shade &mdash; that temporarily blind drivers as they move through the zones. The human eye takes several seconds to adapt between brightness levels. During that adaptation window, a pedestrian in a shadow zone is effectively invisible. This effect is worst during morning and evening hours when sun angle is lowest and the contrast between light and shadow is most extreme.</p>

          <h4>Leaf Litter on Road Surface &mdash; October Through December</h4>
          <p>Fall leaf accumulation on Colony's narrow roads creates a secondary hazard. Wet leaves on pavement extend stopping distances by 20&ndash;40%, meaning a driver who sees a pedestrian at the last moment may be physically unable to stop in time. Leaf-covered road surfaces also hide potholes, road edges, and drainage grates that force pedestrians into the travel lane to avoid tripping hazards.</p>

          <h4>Ice Under Tree Cover &mdash; December Through February</h4>
          <p>Tree-shaded sections of Colony's roads freeze first and thaw last during winter weather events. While sunlit sections of CR-222 may be clear and dry, shaded curves and straightaways harbor isolated black ice patches invisible to both drivers and pedestrians. A driver entering a shaded ice patch at speed loses braking and steering control simultaneously &mdash; with a pedestrian ahead who has no escape route.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Where do I get a copy of my Colony pedestrian accident police report?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Colony has no city police department. All accident reports are filed by the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong>. Contact the Sheriff's Office at <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a> to request your report. Most reports are available within 5&ndash;10 business days. Your attorney can also obtain the report on your behalf.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was hit while walking my dog on Colony's roads?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Dog walking on Colony's roads is a routine, necessary activity in a community without sidewalks. Alabama law requires drivers to exercise <strong>due care</strong> toward pedestrians on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213). If a driver was speeding, distracted, or failed to give you adequate space on Colony's narrow roads, they may be liable for your injuries. Contact Ferguson &amp; Ferguson for a free consultation.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Colony pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. This means if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault &mdash; walking on a road without a sidewalk, wearing dark clothing, or walking your dog in the travel lane &mdash; your entire claim can be denied. In Colony, where no sidewalks exist, Ferguson &amp; Ferguson defeats these arguments by proving the driver's negligence was the sole cause of your injuries.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What types of compensation can I recover after a pedestrian accident in Colony?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Pedestrian accident victims in Colony can recover compensation for current and future medical bills, lost wages and lost earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability or disfigurement, and loss of quality of life. In cases involving extreme negligence &mdash; like a DUI driver or someone texting while driving &mdash; punitive damages may also be available. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson calculates the full long-term value of your claim.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Is Colony's lack of sidewalks relevant to my pedestrian accident case?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes &mdash; and it strengthens your case. Alabama law (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215) only requires pedestrians to use sidewalks <em>when they are available</em>. When no sidewalks exist, walking on the road is a necessity, not negligence. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson uses infrastructure surveys and road data to prove that Colony's roads gave you no safe alternative &mdash; and that the driver's failure to adjust for known residential conditions caused your injuries.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson charge upfront fees for Colony pedestrian accident cases?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
