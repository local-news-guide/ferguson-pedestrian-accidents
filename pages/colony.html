  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Colony Pedestrian Accidents</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-3">A Quiet Community Where Shared Roads Create Danger</h2>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Colony sits along County Road 222 in Cullman County &mdash; a tight-knit community of roughly 350 people where walking is simply part of daily life. Residents walk between neighbors' homes, jog along the road for exercise, and walk their dogs on the same roadways used by vehicles traveling far too fast.</p>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">With no sidewalks, no crosswalks, and no traffic controls, Colony's roads offer zero protection for pedestrians. Community events and church gatherings periodically create clusters of people on foot, but drivers passing through rarely slow down.</p>
  <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents pedestrians struck on Colony's county roads. We understand that small-town walking culture is not negligence &mdash; and we hold drivers accountable when their carelessness injures people in this community.</p>

  <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--2col">
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">1</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Shared Roadways With No Sidewalks</h4><p>Colony has zero dedicated pedestrian infrastructure. Walkers, joggers, and dog walkers share the road surface with vehicles, separated by nothing.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">2</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Speeding on County Roads</h4><p>Drivers treat County Road 222 like open highway, reaching speeds that give them no time to react to pedestrians around curves or over hills.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">3</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Dog Walkers and Joggers at Risk</h4><p>Residents who walk dogs or jog along Colony's roads are forced onto narrow shoulders or the road itself, especially where ditches line the roadside.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">4</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Blind Curves and Hills</h4><p>Colony's winding county roads feature curves and hills that hide pedestrians from approaching drivers until it is too late to stop.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">5</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Church and Community Event Traffic</h4><p>When Colony's churches and community gatherings let out, groups of pedestrians walk along roads simultaneously &mdash; creating unexpected foot traffic.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">6</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>No Lighting After Dark</h4><p>Colony's roads have no street lighting. Evening walkers and anyone returning from a neighbor's home after sunset is essentially invisible to drivers.</p></div></li>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Alabama Pedestrian Law</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Know Your Rights as a Pedestrian in Alabama</h2>
  <div class="ff-law-box"><h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3><ul>
    <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
    <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
    <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
    <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
    <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
    <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
    <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
    <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
    <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
    <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="ff-callout"><p><strong>Small-town walking is not carelessness.</strong> Insurance companies will argue you shouldn't have been walking on a road without sidewalks. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson fights back by proving the driver's negligence was the sole cause of your injuries.</p></div>

  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Colony</h2>
  <ol class="ff-steps">
    <li><div><h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4><p>Call 911. The Cullman County Sheriff and county EMS will respond. An official police report documenting the scene is essential evidence.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4><p>Even if you feel okay, go to Cullman Regional Medical Center. Pedestrian impacts cause internal injuries that may not show symptoms for hours.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Document Everything</h4><p>Photograph the road, lack of shoulders, blind curves, lighting conditions, your injuries, and the vehicle. Get witness contact info from neighbors who saw the accident.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4><p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements to twist against you under Alabama's contributory negligence rule. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson</h4><p>The sooner we are involved, the better we can preserve evidence and protect your claim. Free consultation &mdash; call (256) 350-7200.</p></div></li>

<section id="faq" class="ff-section"><div class="ff-container"><div class="ff-text-center ff-mb-5"><span class="ff-eyebrow">Frequently Asked Questions</span><h2>Pedestrian Accident FAQ &mdash; Colony, Alabama</h2></div>
  <div class="ff-faq">
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Is it negligent to walk on Colony's roads if there are no sidewalks?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>No. Walking on a road without sidewalks is a necessity, not negligence. Alabama law requires drivers to exercise <strong>due care</strong> toward pedestrians on any roadway. Insurance companies will try to blame you for walking on the road, but Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to defeat this argument.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">I was hit while walking my dog on the road in Colony. Can I file a claim?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Dog walking on Colony's roads is a routine activity in a community without sidewalks. Drivers are required to watch for pedestrians at all times. If a driver was speeding, distracted, or failed to give you adequate space, they may be liable for your injuries. Contact Ferguson &amp; Ferguson for a free consultation.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What should I do if I'm hit by a car near Colony's church or a community event?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Call 911 immediately. Document the scene with photos, get witness contact information, and seek medical attention even if you feel okay. Community events create predictable pedestrian traffic that drivers should anticipate. Do not give the insurance company a recorded statement before speaking with an attorney.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect pedestrian accident claims?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Alabama's <strong>contributory negligence</strong> rule means if the insurance company can prove you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim could be denied. They'll argue you wore dark clothing, weren't paying attention, or walked on the wrong side of the road. An experienced attorney is essential to protecting your claim.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What injuries do pedestrians in Colony typically suffer?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Colony's pedestrian accidents often involve vehicles traveling at speed on county roads. Common injuries include broken bones, head trauma, spinal injuries, internal bleeding, and road rash. Even lower-speed impacts between vehicles and pedestrians can cause severe, life-altering injuries.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Does it cost anything to consult with Ferguson &amp; Ferguson about my accident?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>No. Your consultation is completely free, and we work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>. You pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs or hourly fees.</p></div></details>
