        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Hill Country Highways Hiding Pedestrians Behind Every Crest</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Fairview is an unincorporated community of approximately 800 people in eastern Cullman County, where AL-69 and AL-157 converge amid the rolling hills of the southern Appalachian foothills. These state highways carry commuter traffic between Cullman and Arab at speeds that treat this residential community as open road &mdash; not a place where people live and walk.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">The terrain is Fairview's defining hazard. Rolling hills create blind crests where a pedestrian just over a hilltop is invisible to approaching drivers. AL-69's undulating profile gives drivers as little as 2&ndash;3 seconds of visibility before encountering someone on foot. Fairview High School adds daily surges of student foot traffic along corridors designed for through-traffic, not pedestrians.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows how Fairview's terrain, sight-line limitations, and speed combine to create pedestrian dangers that insurance companies try to minimize.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes Fairview, the AL-69 and AL-157 corridors, Fairview High School zone, and all unincorporated areas in eastern Cullman County. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 50 minutes northwest via I-65.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Understanding Fairview's Street-Level Risk</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Every pedestrian accident in Fairview happens at a specific place, shaped by specific terrain. Understanding the rolling hill topography helps explain why certain locations produce more collisions.</p>

          <h4>AL-69 Blind Crests &mdash; The Hidden Pedestrian Problem</h4>
          <p>AL-69 follows the natural terrain through Fairview, rising and falling over a series of hills. Each hilltop creates a blind crest where drivers approaching at 55+ mph cannot see what's on the other side until they're already over the top. Pedestrians walking along the road, crossing to a mailbox, or standing at a driveway entrance are completely hidden from approaching vehicles. By the time a driver sees a pedestrian beyond a crest, stopping distance at highway speed makes collision nearly unavoidable.</p>

          <h4>AL-69 / AL-157 Intersection &mdash; The Community Crossroads</h4>
          <p>Where AL-69 and AL-157 meet, Fairview's commercial activity concentrates. The intersection handles traffic from two state highways converging at different angles, creating complex turning movements. Pedestrians crossing at this junction face vehicles from multiple approach directions, including drivers making high-speed turns who focus on vehicle gaps rather than checking for people on foot.</p>

          <h4>Fairview High School Zone &mdash; Students on a Highway</h4>
          <p>Fairview High School sits along the AL-69 corridor, generating daily surges of student foot traffic during arrival and dismissal. Students walk along road shoulders, cross the highway, and wait at bus stops without sidewalks or protected crossings. The school zone speed reduction is frequently violated by commuters who treat AL-69 as a through-route rather than a school zone.</p>

          <h4>Residential Driveway Zones &mdash; Every Exit Is a Crossing</h4>
          <p>Fairview's homes are spread along AL-69 and county roads, each driveway creating a conflict point where residents on foot cross the path of highway-speed traffic. Checking the mail, walking to a neighbor's home, or taking trash to the road requires stepping into a highway corridor where drivers aren't expecting pedestrians. Vegetation on hillside lots further reduces sight lines at driveway entrances.</p>

          <p>Fairview's county roads connect residential clusters to the AL-69/AL-157 junction with no shoulders, no lighting, and no pedestrian infrastructure. Residents walking to the nearest store or church use road edges shared with traffic that approaches from around blind curves. These narrow roads offer zero buffer between pedestrian and vehicle.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Fairview Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Fairview pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters commonly argue that the pedestrian shouldn't have been walking on the highway, should have crossed at a different location, or should have been wearing reflective clothing. On AL-69's blind crests, they may claim the pedestrian should have anticipated that drivers couldn't see them &mdash; shifting blame from the speeding driver to the pedestrian who had no safe alternative.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Blind crests create a duty to reduce speed.</strong> When road geometry limits a driver's forward visibility, Alabama law requires them to reduce speed to a rate that allows stopping within the visible distance ahead. A driver cresting a hill at 55 mph on AL-69 who strikes a pedestrian was driving too fast for conditions &mdash; regardless of the posted speed limit. Randy Ferguson uses sight-distance analysis and speed calculations to prove this in court.</p>

          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Highway-speed pedestrian impacts cause traumatic brain injuries, spinal damage, and internal bleeding that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records become key evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the road terrain, hill crests, sight-line limitations, the lack of pedestrian infrastructure, your injuries, and the vehicle. Stand where you were struck and photograph what a driver would see approaching from each direction. Note whether the school zone was active.</p>

      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. Their goal is to get you on record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Fairview's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Fairview's location in the rolling foothills of eastern Cullman County &mdash; at approximately 900 feet elevation with significant terrain variation &mdash; produces weather patterns that compound the area's existing sight-line challenges.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>Blind-Crest Fog Pockets &mdash; October Through March</h4>
          <p>Fairview's rolling terrain traps cool air in low-lying areas between hills, creating fog pockets that sit in the valleys while hilltops remain clear. A driver cresting a hill may have clear visibility at the top but drive into dense fog immediately beyond the crest &mdash; exactly where a pedestrian walking in the valley may be hidden. This terrain-driven fog pattern makes Fairview's blind-crest problem exponentially worse during fall and winter mornings.</p>

        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>High-Elevation Wind Gusts &mdash; November Through April</h4>
          <p>Fairview's hilltop exposure creates wind acceleration effects where gusts funnel over and around crests. Pedestrians on exposed hilltop stretches of AL-69 face wind gusts that can physically push them off the road shoulder and into the travel lane. During winter months, sustained winds make walking conditions unpredictable, especially for children and elderly residents.</p>

          <h4>Sun Glare at Crest Lines &mdash; Spring and Fall Equinox</h4>
          <p>During March and September, the sun sits at a low angle that aligns directly with AL-69's crest lines during morning and evening commutes. Drivers approaching a hill crest face blinding sun glare at the exact moment they need maximum forward visibility. Pedestrians on the far side of the crest are completely invisible in the glare. This seasonal alignment produces a predictable spike in near-miss incidents and collisions.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Who responds to pedestrian accidents in Fairview?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Fairview is an unincorporated community in Cullman County, so the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds to accidents. Call 911 or contact the Sheriff directly at <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. For accidents on AL-69, Alabama State Troopers may also respond. Request an official accident report &mdash; it is critical evidence for your claim.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How dangerous are the blind crests on AL-69 through Fairview for pedestrians?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Extremely dangerous. AL-69 follows the rolling terrain of eastern Cullman County, creating blind crests where drivers cannot see beyond the hilltop. Pedestrians walking just over a crest are invisible to approaching vehicles traveling at 55+ mph. Drivers have less than 2&ndash;3 seconds of reaction time after cresting a hill. These sight-line limitations are a key factor in building negligence cases.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Fairview pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. If the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim can be denied. In Fairview, insurance adjusters commonly argue pedestrians should have stayed off the highway or crossed at a different location. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments using sight-line analysis, speed calculations, and road design evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">I was struck near Fairview High School. Does the school zone affect my case?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Drivers owe a <strong>heightened duty of care</strong> in school zones. If the driver was speeding, distracted, or ignoring school zone signs near Fairview High School, that strengthens your claim significantly. Students walking to and from school along AL-69 face particular danger from drivers who treat the highway as a through-route rather than a school zone.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident (Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38). However, evidence deteriorates quickly &mdash; skid marks fade, surveillance footage gets overwritten, and witnesses move away. Contact an attorney as soon as possible after the accident.</p>

        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
