  <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Living Alongside a Dangerous Highway Corridor</h2>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Fairview sits along Alabama Highway 69, a busy corridor that carries commuter traffic, commercial vehicles, and daily travelers between Cullman and Arab through this 800-person community. Homes, businesses, and churches line both sides of the highway, forcing residents to cross or walk alongside fast-moving traffic for basic daily tasks.</p>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">The combination of commercial vehicles, commuters traveling at highway speed, and farm equipment creates a particularly dangerous environment. Large trucks have massive blind spots and require far greater stopping distances. When a driver fails to see a pedestrian crossing Highway 69, the results are catastrophic.</p>
  <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents pedestrians injured along the Highway 69 corridor through Fairview. We know how to investigate commercial vehicle accidents and hold negligent drivers and trucking companies accountable.</p>

  <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--2col">
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">1</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Heavy Commercial Traffic</h4><p>Highway 69 carries a steady stream of commercial vehicles and commuters between Cullman and Arab. Their speed and volume make the corridor especially dangerous for pedestrians.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">2</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Dangerous Highway Crossings</h4><p>Fairview residents must cross Highway 69 to reach businesses, churches, and neighbors on the opposite side. Without crosswalks or signals, every crossing is a gamble.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">3</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Excessive Speed</h4><p>Drivers maintaining highway speed through Fairview can't stop in time when pedestrians appear at driveways, intersections, or road shoulders.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">4</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Commercial Vehicle Blind Spots</h4><p>Large trucks have blind spots on all four sides. Pedestrians visible to a car driver may be completely invisible to a trucker making a right turn.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">5</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Limited Visibility at Curves</h4><p>Sections of Highway 69 through Fairview feature curves that hide pedestrians from approaching vehicles until the last moment.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">6</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>No Pedestrian Signals</h4><p>Fairview has no pedestrian crossing signals along the Highway 69 corridor. Residents must judge gaps in traffic themselves when crossing.</p></div></li>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Alabama Pedestrian Law</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Know Your Rights as a Pedestrian in Alabama</h2>
  <div class="ff-law-box"><h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3><ul>
    <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
    <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
    <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
    <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
    <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
    <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
    <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
    <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
    <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
    <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="ff-callout"><p><strong>Commercial vehicle accidents require specialized investigation.</strong> Commercial vehicles carry electronic logs, dashcam footage, and maintenance records that can prove negligence. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to obtain this evidence before companies destroy it.</p></div>

  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Fairview</h2>
  <ol class="ff-steps">
    <li><div><h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4><p>Call 911 immediately. Highway 69 accidents often involve commercial vehicles and severe injuries. Ensure law enforcement documents any commercial vehicle information.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4><p>Go to Cullman Regional Medical Center immediately. Vehicle-pedestrian impacts cause catastrophic injuries requiring urgent evaluation.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Document Everything</h4><p>Photograph everything: the vehicle, company markings, license plates, your injuries, road conditions, and the lack of crosswalks or pedestrian signals.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4><p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements to twist against you under Alabama's contributory negligence rule. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson</h4><p>The sooner we are involved, the better we can preserve evidence and protect your claim. Free consultation &mdash; call (256) 350-7200.</p></div></li>

<section id="faq" class="ff-section"><div class="ff-container"><div class="ff-text-center ff-mb-5"><span class="ff-eyebrow">Frequently Asked Questions</span><h2>Pedestrian Accident FAQ &mdash; Fairview, Alabama</h2></div>
  <div class="ff-faq">
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">I was hit by a commercial vehicle while crossing Highway 69 in Fairview. What should I do?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Call 911 immediately and seek emergency medical care. Vehicle-pedestrian impacts cause catastrophic injuries. Document the vehicle's company markings, license plate, and any DOT numbers. <strong>Do not speak to the company's insurance adjuster</strong> &mdash; contact Ferguson &amp; Ferguson first. We can issue evidence preservation letters to prevent the company from destroying electronic logs and dashcam footage.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Are trucking companies liable when their drivers hit pedestrians in Fairview?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Under federal law and Alabama liability rules, trucking companies are responsible for the actions of their drivers. They're also required to maintain vehicles, enforce hours-of-service rules, and ensure driver training. If any of these obligations were violated, the company may owe you additional compensation beyond what the driver's insurance covers.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Why are truck accidents different from regular car-pedestrian accidents?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Truck accidents involve larger vehicles traveling at higher speeds with greater mass, causing far more severe injuries. They also involve complex liability &mdash; the driver, the trucking company, the vehicle manufacturer, and even cargo loaders may share fault. Electronic evidence (logs, GPS, dashcams) must be preserved quickly before it's overwritten.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How dangerous is Highway 69 through Fairview for pedestrians?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Extremely dangerous. Highway 69 carries a steady stream of commercial vehicles and commuters at highway speed through a community of 800 people. There are no pedestrian crosswalks, no traffic signals, and limited visibility at curves. Large trucks have massive blind spots that make pedestrians invisible to drivers making turns.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What types of compensation can truck accident victims recover?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Truck-pedestrian accidents typically involve severe injuries and high compensation values. You may recover medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, permanent disability, loss of earning capacity, and in some cases punitive damages if the trucker or company acted recklessly. Multiple liable parties can increase the total compensation available.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson handle truck accident cases on a contingency basis?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Like all our pedestrian accident cases, truck accident cases are handled on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>. You pay nothing unless we win. Given the complexity of trucking cases, having experienced attorneys at no upfront cost is critical.</p></div></details>
