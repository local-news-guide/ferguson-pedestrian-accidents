        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Good Hope's Growth Has Outpaced Its Pedestrian Infrastructure</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Good Hope sits at the crossroads of Interstate 65 and Alabama Highway 69 &mdash; a geographic position that has transformed this once-quiet community into one of Cullman County's fastest-growing transit hubs. With a population approaching 2,500 and steady residential development spreading outward from the interchange, the gap between vehicle speed and pedestrian safety grows wider every year.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">The I-65 interchange at Exit 305, the Highway 69 commercial corridor, Good Hope High School, gas stations and convenience stores clustered near the interstate, and new residential pockets south toward Smith Lake all generate pedestrian traffic in areas where drivers aren't expecting it &mdash; and where no sidewalks, crosswalks, or pedestrian signals exist to protect them.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows these interchange ramps, these frontage road blind spots, and these insurance company tactics &mdash; because he's built cases around them before.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes Good Hope, unincorporated areas along I-65 and Highway 69, and all 12 communities in our Cullman County service network. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 40 minutes north via I-65.</p>

          <h4>I-65 Interchange (Exit 305) &mdash; The County's Highest-Speed Conflict Zone</h4>
          <p>Exit 305 funnels interstate traffic traveling 70+ mph onto ramps that merge directly into Good Hope's local road network. Drivers decelerating from highway speed routinely misjudge the transition to 35&ndash;45 mph zones. Pedestrians crossing near the interchange &mdash; walking to gas stations, fast-food restaurants, or commercial lots &mdash; face vehicles from multiple approach angles, including ramp traffic that is still carrying interstate momentum.</p>

          <h4>Highway 69 Corridor &mdash; Good Hope's Main Artery</h4>
          <p>Alabama Highway 69 runs north-south through the center of Good Hope, connecting the community to Cullman to the north and Smith Lake access to the south. The highway carries a mix of local traffic, regional commuters, and heavy vehicles at speeds up to 55 mph. No continuous sidewalk infrastructure exists along Highway 69 through town, forcing residents to walk on narrow gravel shoulders inches from passing traffic.</p>

          <h4>Frontage Road Friction &mdash; High Speed, Zero Pedestrian Design</h4>
          <p>The frontage roads paralleling I-65 near Exit 305 serve commercial properties, fuel stations, and restaurants. These roads were engineered for vehicle throughput, not pedestrian movement. Wide lanes, long sight lines, and high travel speeds create a false sense of open road for drivers &mdash; while pedestrians crossing between businesses, parking lots, and fuel islands have no protected paths, no crosswalks, and no signals.</p>

          <p>Good Hope High School generates concentrated pedestrian traffic twice daily as students, parents, and staff converge on the campus. Drop-off and pickup queues spill onto adjacent roads. Students walking to and from school navigate road shoulders and uncontrolled crossings in areas where the speed limit drops but driver compliance does not. The transition from school zone to standard highway speed happens abruptly.</p>

          <p>Good Hope's residential neighborhoods sit within walking distance of commercial clusters near the interstate, but no dedicated pedestrian infrastructure connects them. Residents walking to convenience stores, restaurants, or workplaces must travel along road shoulders, cross Highway 69, and navigate parking lot entrances designed exclusively for vehicle access. The gap between where people live and where they need to go on foot is bridged entirely by roadways built for cars.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Good Hope Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Good Hope pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters exploit the community's lack of pedestrian infrastructure as a weapon against victims. They argue that walking on a road shoulder along Highway 69 was reckless, that crossing a frontage road without a crosswalk was contributory fault, or that a pedestrian near the I-65 interchange should have known the area was dangerous. These arguments flip the infrastructure failure onto the person who had no other choice.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>No sidewalk does not mean no rights.</strong> In Good Hope, where continuous sidewalk infrastructure is virtually nonexistent, insurance companies routinely argue that shoulder-walking or crossing Highway 69 constitutes contributory negligence. Alabama law requires drivers to exercise due care regardless of whether sidewalks exist (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213). Randy Ferguson uses road design evidence, ALDOT design standards, and scene documentation to prove the infrastructure &mdash; not the pedestrian &mdash; created the hazard.</p>

          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Pedestrian impacts commonly cause traumatic brain injuries, internal bleeding, and spinal injuries that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records created immediately after the accident become key evidence in your claim.</p>

          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the intersection, road shoulders, traffic signals, the vehicle, your injuries, any skid marks, and sight-line obstructions. Get contact information from witnesses. Note the time, weather, and lighting conditions. If there's a nearby traffic camera, interstate camera, or business security camera, note its location.</p>

          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. Their goal is to get you on the record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Good Hope's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Good Hope's position along the I-65 corridor and its proximity to Smith Lake drainage produce weather patterns that directly affect pedestrian visibility and driver stopping distances.</p>

          <h4>Morning Fog &mdash; Smith Lake Drainage Effect</h4>
          <p>Low-lying areas near Good Hope collect moisture from Smith Lake drainage to the south, producing dense ground-level fog during fall and winter mornings. Visibility on Highway 69 and along I-65 interchange ramps can drop below 200 feet during the morning commute. Pedestrians walking to school, bus stops, or work along road shoulders become invisible to drivers until it's too late to stop. Morning fog accidents peak between 6:30 AM and 8:00 AM.</p>

          <h4>I-65 Corridor Wind Gusts &amp; Spray</h4>
          <p>The I-65 corridor through Good Hope creates a wind-tunnel effect, particularly near the Exit 305 interchange. Tractor-trailers and high-speed traffic generate wind gusts and road spray that affect pedestrians walking near interchange ramps, frontage roads, and gas station lots. During rain, spray from passing trucks can blind pedestrians and drivers simultaneously, reducing reaction time to near zero at the moments when stopping distances are already extended.</p>

          <h4>Summer Storm Flash Flooding at Low-Lying Intersections</h4>
          <p>North Alabama's convective storm season produces sudden, heavy downpours that overwhelm drainage at Good Hope's low-lying intersections. Standing water accumulates rapidly near the I-65 underpass areas and at low points along Highway 69. Pedestrians seeking shelter rush across roads. Drivers hydroplane on flooded pavement. The combination of reduced visibility, extended stopping distances, and panicked movement creates the conditions for high-speed pedestrian collisions.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Where do I get a copy of my Good Hope pedestrian accident police report?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>If <strong>Good Hope Police Department</strong> responded, contact them at <a href="tel:+12567394221">(256) 739-4221</a>. If the accident occurred outside Good Hope city limits on I-65 or unincorporated areas of Highway 69, the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> handles the report &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. Most reports are available within 5&ndash;10 business days. Your attorney can also obtain the report on your behalf.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was walking on a road shoulder in Good Hope because there was no sidewalk?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. The absence of sidewalks does not make shoulder-walking negligent. Alabama law requires drivers to exercise due care to avoid hitting any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213), regardless of whether sidewalks exist. Insurance companies routinely argue that pedestrians on Highway 69 or frontage roads assumed the risk by walking where there was no sidewalk. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson has defeated this argument in Cullman County cases by proving the infrastructure &mdash; not the pedestrian &mdash; created the hazard.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Good Hope pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. This means if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault &mdash; walking on a road shoulder, wearing dark clothing, crossing Highway 69 outside a crosswalk &mdash; your entire claim can be denied. In Good Hope, where sidewalks are largely nonexistent and crosswalks are rare, insurance companies exploit these infrastructure gaps to blame pedestrians. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments using road design evidence, ALDOT standards, and scene documentation.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">My child was injured near Good Hope High School. What are our legal options?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Drivers owe an elevated duty of care in school zones. If a driver struck your child near Good Hope High School while speeding, distracted, or failing to yield, they may be liable for all medical costs, pain and suffering, and other damages. Alabama allows parents to file claims on behalf of minor children. The 2-year statute of limitations runs from the date of the accident, but for minors the deadline may differ. Contact Ferguson &amp; Ferguson immediately &mdash; we will investigate the accident, preserve evidence, and protect your family's rights.</p>

          <p>Pedestrian accident victims in Good Hope can recover compensation for current and future medical bills, lost wages and lost earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability or disfigurement, and loss of quality of life. In cases involving extreme negligence &mdash; like a DUI driver or someone texting while driving on Highway 69 &mdash; punitive damages may also be available.
