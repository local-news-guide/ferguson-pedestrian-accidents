        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">An Interstate Exit Built for Trucks &mdash; Not Pedestrians</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Dodge City is an unincorporated community of roughly 400 people in western Cullman County, defined almost entirely by its relationship to I-65 Exit 299. What was once a quiet rural crossroads has become a commercial staging area for interstate travelers &mdash; truck stops, fuel plazas, fast-food restaurants, and convenience stores line the exit ramp corridors. But the pedestrian infrastructure never followed.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Workers at these commercial establishments walk between businesses without sidewalks, crossing wide commercial driveways designed for 18-wheelers. Travelers on foot moving between fuel islands and restaurants navigate parking lots filled with idling trucks and distracted drivers. CR-1243, the primary local road, carries both residential traffic and heavy commercial vehicles with no shoulders or crossings.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows how interstate exit commercial zones create unique pedestrian dangers that insurance companies try to minimize.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes Dodge City, the I-65 Exit 299 commercial corridor, CR-1243, and all unincorporated areas in western Cullman County. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 30 minutes north via I-65.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Understanding Dodge City's Street-Level Risk</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Every pedestrian accident in Dodge City happens at a specific place, shaped by specific infrastructure. Understanding the commercial corridor's layout helps explain why certain locations produce more collisions.</p>

          <h4>I-65 Exit 299 Commercial Zone &mdash; The Pedestrian Dead Zone</h4>
          <p>The interchange at I-65 and CR-1243 is surrounded by truck stops, fuel plazas, and restaurants built to serve interstate traffic. Every one of these businesses generates pedestrian foot traffic &mdash; employees walking between shifts, travelers walking to restaurants, truck drivers walking between fuel islands and stores. But the road geometry is designed exclusively for vehicle throughput. There are no crosswalks, no pedestrian signals, and no sidewalks connecting any of these commercial properties.</p>

          <h4>CR-1243 Corridor &mdash; The Local Road That Became a Freight Route</h4>
          <p>County Road 1243 connects Dodge City's residential areas to the I-65 interchange and continues east toward Cullman. It was designed as a two-lane rural road but now carries heavy commercial traffic from the truck stops and fuel plazas. There are no shoulders, no sidewalks, and no lighting. Pedestrians walking along CR-1243 share the road edge with fully loaded tractor-trailers.</p>

          <h4>Freight Staging Areas &mdash; Hidden Pedestrian Conflict Zones</h4>
          <p>Behind the truck stops and fuel plazas, unpaved or poorly maintained staging areas serve as parking for long-haul trucks. Drivers walk between these staging lots and the commercial businesses on foot, crossing driveways and access roads with limited visibility. These areas have no lighting, no marked paths, and no separation between pedestrian and vehicle traffic.</p>

          <p>Vehicles exiting I-65 at Exit 299 carry interstate speed (70+ mph) into a zone where pedestrians may be present within 500 feet. The deceleration ramp is designed for vehicle speed management, not pedestrian safety. Anyone walking near the ramp termini &mdash; including truck drivers walking to nearby businesses &mdash; faces vehicles that haven't fully transitioned from highway to local speed.</p>

Residents walking to the nearest convenience store or restaurant must navigate commercial driveways and parking lots designed for commercial vehicle turning radii &mdash; not human-scale movement.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Dodge City Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Dodge City pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters commonly argue that the pedestrian shouldn't have been walking in a commercial zone, should have driven instead, or failed to watch for truck traffic. At the I-65 Exit 299 interchange, they may claim the pedestrian entered a commercial driveway without looking &mdash; ignoring the fact that no pedestrian infrastructure exists to provide a safe alternative.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Commercial zones have higher duties of care.</strong> Truck stop and fuel plaza operators know pedestrians walk their properties. They have a duty to provide safe pathways, adequate lighting, and proper sight lines. When they fail to do so &mdash; and a pedestrian is struck &mdash; the property owner may share liability alongside the driver. Randy Ferguson investigates property conditions, lighting surveys, and maintenance records to build the strongest possible case.</p>

    <ol class="ff-steps">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call 911 &mdash; Cullman County Sheriff</h4>
          <p>Dodge City is unincorporated Cullman County, so the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a> or dial 911. For commercial vehicle accidents at truck stops, Alabama State Troopers may also respond. An official accident report is critical evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Pedestrian impacts involving commercial trucks cause crush injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and internal bleeding that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records become key evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the parking lot, driveways, lighting conditions, truck identification numbers (DOT and MC numbers on commercial vehicles), your injuries, any skid marks, and the lack of pedestrian infrastructure. Note the names of businesses and any surveillance cameras visible.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Trucking companies and their insurers will send adjusters fast &mdash; sometimes within hours. Their goal is to get you on record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Dodge City's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Dodge City's location along the I-65 corridor in western Cullman County &mdash; surrounded by open agricultural land and vast paved commercial surfaces &mdash; produces weather conditions that directly affect pedestrian visibility and driver stopping distances.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>Heat Shimmer on Asphalt &mdash; May Through September</h4>
          <p>Dodge City's commercial corridor contains acres of dark asphalt parking lots and staging areas. During summer months, radiant heat creates visible shimmer that distorts driver perception of objects at ground level. Pedestrians walking across sun-heated parking lots can appear to flicker or blend into the heat mirage, delaying driver reaction time by critical seconds.</p>

          <h4>Interstate Wind Gusts &mdash; Year-Round</h4>
          <p>I-65 traffic generates sustained wind corridors along the exit ramp areas. Passing tractor-trailers at 70+ mph produce wind blasts that can physically destabilize pedestrians walking near the roadway. During winter months, wind chill near the interstate makes pedestrians rush across roads rather than wait for safe crossing opportunities.</p>

          <h4>Diesel Exhaust Haze &mdash; November Through March</h4>
          <p>Cold-weather idling at truck stops and staging areas produces persistent low-lying diesel exhaust that reduces ground-level visibility. During early morning and evening hours, this exhaust mixes with cool air to create a localized haze that obscures pedestrians from drivers and drivers from pedestrians. The effect is worst in the staging areas behind truck stops where lighting is already minimal.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Who responds to pedestrian accidents in Dodge City?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Dodge City is an unincorporated community in Cullman County, so the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds to accidents. Call 911 or contact the Sheriff directly at <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. EMS and fire services are dispatched through Cullman County. Request an official accident report &mdash; it is critical evidence for your claim.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">I was hit while walking through a truck stop parking lot near I-65 Exit 299. Can I file a claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Truck stop and fuel plaza parking lots are private property, but Alabama negligence laws still apply. Drivers of both commercial trucks and passenger vehicles owe pedestrians a duty of care in parking areas. Truck stop lots present unique dangers &mdash; large vehicles with massive blind spots, diesel-slicked surfaces, and drivers fatigued from long hauls. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson handles parking lot pedestrian accident cases involving commercial vehicles.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Dodge City pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. If the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim can be denied. In Dodge City, insurance adjusters commonly argue pedestrians shouldn't have been walking in a commercial zone. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments by proving the driver's negligence and the absence of pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim against a trucking company if their driver hit me in Dodge City?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Trucking companies are liable for the actions of their drivers under <strong>respondeat superior</strong>. They are also independently liable if they failed to maintain safe vehicles, hired unqualified drivers, or violated hours-of-service regulations. Commercial vehicle accident cases often involve multiple liable parties &mdash; the driver, the trucking company, and potentially the truck stop owner. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson investigates all responsible parties.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident (Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38). However, truck stop and commercial vehicle accidents require immediate evidence preservation &mdash; surveillance footage is overwritten, truck logs are altered, and witnesses disperse. Contact an attorney as soon as possible.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson charge upfront fees for Dodge City pedestrian accident cases?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
