  <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Highway Speed Through the Heart of a Walking Community</h2>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Baileyton sits along a busy state highway corridor. Alabama Highway 69 carries thousands of vehicles daily through a town of about 500 people where residents still walk between neighbors' homes, stroll to church on Sunday mornings, and cross the road to check their mailboxes.</p>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">That collision between high-speed through-traffic and small-town walking patterns creates serious danger. With no sidewalks along most of Highway 69, no pedestrian signals, and limited street lighting after dark, Baileyton pedestrians face extraordinary risk every time they step near the roadway.</p>
  <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents pedestrians struck on Highway 69 and throughout Cullman County's rural roads. We understand how these crashes happen in small communities where drivers expect open highway, not people on foot.</p>

  <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--2col">
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">1</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Highway 69 Speed Differential</h4><p>Drivers accustomed to 55+ mph on rural stretches fail to slow down entering town limits. Pedestrians near driveways and crossings have almost no reaction time.</p></div></li>

    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">3</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Poor Nighttime Visibility</h4><p>Limited street lighting on Highway 69 leaves pedestrians nearly invisible after dark. Evening walkers face extreme risk on overcast nights.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">4</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Mailbox and Roadside Errands</h4><p>Residents crossing Highway 69 to check mail or visit neighbors face fast-moving traffic with no marked crossings or pedestrian signals.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">5</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Distracted Highway Drivers</h4><p>Long stretches of Highway 69 encourage phone use and inattention. Drivers look up too late when a pedestrian appears on a road they assumed was empty.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">6</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Residential Road Walking</h4><p>Baileyton's culture of walking between neighbors and to churches puts pedestrians on narrow roads where drivers speed around blind curves.</p></div></li>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Alabama Pedestrian Law</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Know Your Rights as a Pedestrian in Alabama</h2>
  <div class="ff-law-box"><h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3><ul>
    <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
    <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
    <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
    <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
    <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
    <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
    <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
    <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
    <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
    <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="ff-callout"><p><strong>Walking on the shoulder is not negligence.</strong> Insurance companies will argue you shouldn't have been walking along Highway 69. But when there are no sidewalks, Alabama law still requires drivers to exercise due care. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to defeat these bad-faith arguments.</p></div>

  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Baileyton</h2>
  <ol class="ff-steps">
    <li><div><h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4><p>Get medical help and an official police report. Cullman County EMS and Baileyton Volunteer Fire respond to Highway 69 crashes. Alabama State Troopers or the Sheriff will document the scene.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4><p>Even if you feel okay, go to Cullman Regional Medical Center. Internal injuries from pedestrian impacts often don't show symptoms for hours.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Document Everything</h4><p>Photograph the scene, your injuries, the vehicle, road conditions, and the lack of sidewalks. Get witness contact information before they leave.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4><p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements to twist against you. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson</h4><p>The sooner we're involved, the better we can preserve evidence and protect your claim. Free consultation &mdash; call (256) 350-7200.</p></div></li>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Is it negligent to walk along Highway 69 in Baileyton if there's no sidewalk?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. When there are no sidewalks or alternative pedestrian paths, walking along the road shoulder is a necessity, not negligence. Alabama law requires drivers to exercise <strong>due care</strong> to avoid hitting pedestrians on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213). Insurance companies will try to blame you for walking where there's no sidewalk, but Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to defeat this argument.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What makes Highway 69 through Baileyton so dangerous for pedestrians?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Highway 69 carries high-speed traffic through a small community of about 500 people who walk as part of daily life. The speed differential is the core problem &mdash; drivers accustomed to 55+ mph on rural stretches don't slow down entering Baileyton. Combined with no sidewalks, no pedestrian signals, and minimal street lighting, pedestrians have almost no protection from vehicles.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">I was hit while checking my mailbox across Highway 69. Can I sue?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Crossing Highway 69 to check your mailbox is a routine daily task, not reckless behavior. Drivers are required to maintain awareness of pedestrians on any roadway. If a driver was speeding, distracted, or failed to yield, they may be liable for your injuries. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson has handled cases involving routine residential crossings on Highway 69.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What types of injuries do Baileyton pedestrian accident victims suffer?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Due to the high speeds on Highway 69, pedestrian injuries in Baileyton tend to be severe: traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple broken bones, internal organ damage, crush injuries, and road rash. At highway speeds, even a "glancing" impact can cause life-altering or fatal injuries.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long after a pedestrian accident do I have to file a claim in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident. However, evidence deteriorates quickly &mdash; skid marks fade, surveillance footage gets overwritten, and witnesses' memories become less reliable. Contact an attorney as soon as possible to preserve the strongest possible case.</p>
