        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Highway Speed Through a Community Built for Walking</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Baileyton is a small community of roughly 500 people in northeast Cullman County, situated where Alabama Highway 67 and Highway 69 channel regional traffic through a landscape that was never designed for the speeds it now carries. There are no sidewalks, no pedestrian signals, and no crosswalks. Residents walk to neighbors' homes, stroll to church on Sunday mornings, and cross the highway to check their mailboxes &mdash; all alongside vehicles traveling 55 mph or faster.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">The surrounding terrain compounds the danger. Rolling hills and dense vegetation along both corridors create blind crests and obscured sightlines at uncontrolled rural intersections. Drivers crest a hill at highway speed and encounter a pedestrian walking on the shoulder with no warning and no room to stop. When a 4,000-pound vehicle meets a person on foot at those speeds, the injuries are catastrophic.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows these roads, these sight-line problems, and the insurance company tactics designed to blame rural pedestrians for simply existing where no pedestrian infrastructure was ever built.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes Baileyton, Fairview, South Vinemont, Holly Pond, and all communities across the county. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 50 minutes north via SR-69 and I-65.</p>

    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Every pedestrian accident in Baileyton happens at a specific place, shaped by specific infrastructure failures. Understanding the topography helps explain why this small community faces outsized pedestrian danger.</p>

          <h4>Highway 67 / Highway 69 Intersection &mdash; The Town's Central Crossing</h4>
          <p>The junction of Alabama Highway 67 and Highway 69 is Baileyton's primary intersection and its most dangerous pedestrian zone. Both highways carry through-traffic at rural highway speeds, and the intersection lacks any pedestrian infrastructure &mdash; no crosswalks, no walk signals, no refuge islands. Residents crossing on foot must judge gaps in multi-directional traffic from vehicles that have no expectation of encountering pedestrians. Turning vehicles add additional conflict points where drivers scan for cars, not people.</p>

          <h4>Rolling Hills and Blind Crests &mdash; The Sightline Problem</h4>
          <p>Baileyton sits in the rolling terrain of northeast Cullman County. Both Highway 67 and Highway 69 rise and fall over successive hills, creating blind crests where a driver at highway speed cannot see a pedestrian on the opposite side of the rise until both are within 100 to 200 feet of each other. At 55 mph, that leaves roughly 2 seconds of reaction time &mdash; far less than the minimum stopping distance on even dry pavement. Dense vegetation along both shoulders further compresses available sightlines.</p>

          <h4>No Pedestrian Infrastructure &mdash; Shoulder Walking as the Only Option</h4>
          <p>Baileyton has no sidewalks, no paved pedestrian paths, and no separated walking infrastructure of any kind. Residents who walk &mdash; to a neighbor's house, to church, to check the mail &mdash; do so on grass margins, gravel shoulders, or the road surface itself. Where drainage ditches line both sides of the highway, pedestrians are forced into the travel lane. This is not a choice; it is the only available geometry.</p>

          <h4>Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads &mdash; Speed Differential Hazard</h4>
          <p>Cullman County is agricultural land. During planting and harvest seasons, slow-moving tractors, combines, and grain trucks share Highway 67 and Highway 69 with passenger vehicles traveling at full highway speed. Pedestrians walking on the shoulder face a compounded risk: fast-moving cars swerving to pass farm equipment may cross the fog line directly into the space where a pedestrian is walking. The speed differential between a 15 mph tractor and a 55 mph automobile is itself a lethal hazard.</p>

          <h4>Residential Road Walking Culture &mdash; Daily Foot Traffic Without Protection</h4>
          <p>Baileyton's residential character means foot traffic is woven into daily life. Families walk to visit neighbors. Children walk along roads to reach friends' houses. Churchgoers walk to services on Sunday mornings. This walking culture exists on roads designed exclusively for vehicle throughput. No speed reduction zones, no warning signage, and no infrastructure acknowledge that people regularly travel these roads on foot.</p>

Drivers crest a hill or round a curve and encounter a pedestrian mid-crossing with no time to react. These routine daily crossings produce some of Baileyton's most serious pedestrian injuries.</p>

          <p>Baileyton families walk to local churches along roads with no shoulders or pedestrian paths. Groups including elderly parishioners and young children share the road with drivers who may not expect foot traffic on an otherwise empty rural highway. Low morning sun angle can compound visibility problems during the exact hours church traffic peaks.</p>

          <h4>Agricultural Equipment Speed Differential</h4>
          <p>During harvest season, fast-moving vehicles overtake slow-moving farm equipment on Highway 67 and Highway 69. Drivers pulling into the oncoming lane or swinging wide onto the shoulder to pass a tractor may strike a pedestrian walking in the margin. The combination of speed, impatience, and reduced sightlines behind large equipment makes these encounters especially dangerous.</p>

          <h4>Blind Hill Crests</h4>
          <p>The rolling terrain along both highways produces repeated blind crests where northbound and southbound drivers cannot see pedestrians walking on the far side of a hill. A vehicle traveling at 55 mph covers 80 feet per second. If a pedestrian appears at 150 feet, the driver has less than 2 seconds to identify, react, and brake &mdash; an impossibility at highway speed on a two-lane road.</p>

          <p>Baileyton has minimal street lighting along both Highway 67 and Highway 69. Residents walking on the shoulder after dark are nearly invisible to approaching drivers. Without reflective gear, a pedestrian in dark clothing on an unlit rural highway may not be visible until the vehicle is within 50 to 100 feet &mdash; far below stopping distance at any legal speed.</p>

          <p>Side roads and residential driveways intersect Highway 67 and Highway 69 at uncontrolled points throughout the Baileyton area. Vehicles pulling onto the highway from side roads focus on traffic gaps, not pedestrians walking along the shoulder. Left-turning vehicles accelerating from a stop are a particular threat to pedestrians already in the roadway.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Baileyton Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Baileyton pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters aggressively argue that the pedestrian was walking on the road, failed to wear reflective clothing, or crossed outside a marked intersection. In a community where no crosswalks, sidewalks, or pedestrian signals exist, these arguments attempt to penalize people for living in a place that was never given pedestrian infrastructure. Walking on the shoulder of Highway 69 is not negligence when the shoulder is the only option.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>

      <p><strong>Walking on the shoulder is not negligence.</strong> In Baileyton, where no sidewalks exist anywhere in the community, Alabama Code &sect; 32-5A-215 does not create a duty to use a sidewalk that was never built. Insurance companies will argue you shouldn't have been walking along Highway 67 or Highway 69. Randy Ferguson uses road design evidence, ALDOT infrastructure records, and the complete absence of pedestrian alternatives to dismantle these bad-faith defenses.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Baileyton</h2>
    <ol class="ff-steps">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call 911 &mdash; Cullman County Sheriff</h4>
          <p>Baileyton does not have a city police department. The <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds to all accidents in the Baileyton area &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. Alabama State Troopers may also respond to Highway 67 and Highway 69 incidents. <strong>Baileyton Volunteer Fire Department</strong> provides first-response assistance. An official accident report is critical evidence for your claim.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Get to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Baileyton is approximately 15 miles from CRMC. Pedestrian impacts at highway speed commonly cause traumatic brain injuries, internal bleeding, and spinal injuries that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records created immediately after the accident become key evidence in your claim.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the road, the absence of sidewalks or crosswalks, the vehicle, your injuries, any skid marks, shoulder conditions, and sight-line obstructions like hills or vegetation. Get contact information from witnesses. Note the time, weather, lighting conditions, and whether agricultural equipment was present on the road.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. Their goal is to get you on the record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence &mdash; especially that you "chose" to walk on the road. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson &mdash; (256) 350-7200</h4>
          <p>The sooner we're involved, the better we can preserve evidence, document the absence of pedestrian infrastructure, interview witnesses while memories are fresh, and protect your claim from insurance company tactics designed to deny it.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Baileyton's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Baileyton's position in the rolling terrain of northeast Cullman County produces weather and road conditions that directly amplify pedestrian danger on two-lane highways with no walking infrastructure.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

          <h4>Seasonal Morning Fog on Two-Lane Highways</h4>
          <p>Low-lying areas along Highway 67 and Highway 69 trap cold overnight air, producing dense ground-level fog during early morning hours from October through March. Visibility on these two-lane highways can drop below 200 feet &mdash; well inside the stopping distance for a vehicle at 55 mph. Pedestrians walking to work, to a bus stop, or along the shoulder for morning exercise become invisible until a driver is on top of them. Morning fog accidents peak between 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM, exactly when shoulder-walking traffic is highest.</p>

          <h4>Harvest Season Agricultural Machinery</h4>
          <p>During planting and harvest seasons &mdash; roughly April through June and September through November &mdash; the volume of slow-moving agricultural equipment on Baileyton's highways increases dramatically. Tractors, combines, and loaded grain trucks traveling at 15 to 20 mph on roads where passenger vehicles travel 55 mph create a "speed differential" hazard. Drivers swerve to pass farm equipment, crossing the fog line into shoulder space where pedestrians walk. The combination of impatient drivers, large equipment blocking sightlines, and pedestrians sharing the same narrow corridor is a recipe for catastrophic injury.</p>

          <h4>Winter Ice on Shaded Curves</h4>
          <p>The rolling, wooded terrain around Baileyton produces shaded road sections that retain ice long after exposed pavement has cleared. On Highway 67 and Highway 69, shaded curves and north-facing slopes remain icy when the rest of the road appears dry. Drivers who encounter unexpected ice on a curve lose braking and steering control simultaneously. Pedestrians walking on the shoulder of a shaded curve have no protection from a vehicle sliding across the fog line.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How do I get a copy of my Baileyton pedestrian accident police report?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Baileyton does not have a city police department. All accident reports are filed by the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> or Alabama State Troopers. Contact the Cullman County Sheriff's Office at <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a> or visit their office at 2029 2nd Avenue SW, Cullman, AL 35055. Most reports are available within 5&ndash;10 business days. Your attorney can also obtain the report on your behalf.</p>
        </div>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was hit while crossing Highway 69 to check my mailbox?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Crossing Highway 69 to check your mailbox is a routine daily task, not reckless behavior. Alabama law requires drivers to exercise due care to avoid hitting pedestrians on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213). Drivers traveling at highway speed through a residential area have a heightened duty to watch for pedestrians engaged in ordinary activities. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson has handled cases involving routine residential crossings on rural highways.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Is it negligent to walk along the shoulder of Highway 67 or Highway 69 if there's no sidewalk?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. When no sidewalk or alternative pedestrian path exists, walking along the road shoulder is a necessity, not negligence. Alabama Code &sect; 32-5A-215 only requires pedestrians to use sidewalks where they are available. In Baileyton, where virtually no sidewalks exist, shoulder walking is the only option. Insurance companies will try to blame you for being on the roadway, but this argument fails when there is no pedestrian infrastructure. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to defeat these bad-faith defenses.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Baileyton pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. This means if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault &mdash; walking on the road without reflective clothing, crossing outside an intersection &mdash; your entire claim can be denied. In rural areas like Baileyton where there are no crosswalks, sidewalks, or pedestrian signals, insurance companies aggressively use this defense. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments using road design evidence, traffic speed data, and the absence of any pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was injured by agricultural equipment on a Baileyton road?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Operators of agricultural machinery on public roads owe the same duty of care to pedestrians as any motor vehicle driver. Farm equipment that is oversized, lacks proper signage, or is operated without regard for pedestrians near the roadway can create liability for the operator and potentially the equipment owner. During harvest season in Baileyton, the mix of slow-moving farm equipment and fast-moving highway traffic creates dangerous conditions for anyone on foot.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson charge upfront fees for Baileyton pedestrian accident cases?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
