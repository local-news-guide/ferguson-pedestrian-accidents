  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Berlin Pedestrian Accidents</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Rural Roads Where Pedestrians Have No Safe Space</h2>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Berlin is a small agricultural community in Cullman County where narrow county roads serve as the only path for both vehicles and pedestrians. There are no sidewalks, no paved shoulders, and no street lights on most roads. When residents walk to check their mail, visit a neighbor, or get exercise, they share the road with cars, trucks, and farm equipment.</p>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">The lack of any pedestrian infrastructure means that when a driver is distracted, speeding, or impaired, there is literally nowhere for a pedestrian to go. Ditches on one side, fast-moving traffic on the other &mdash; Berlin's roads force an impossible choice on people who simply need to walk.</p>
  <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents pedestrians injured on Cullman County's rural roads. We understand that the absence of sidewalks does not make walking negligent &mdash; and we fight to make sure insurance companies can't use rural infrastructure failures against you.</p>

  <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--2col">
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">1</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Narrow Roads With No Shoulders</h4><p>Berlin's county roads have pavement that ends abruptly at ditches or grass. Pedestrians have inches of space between themselves and passing vehicles.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">2</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Zero Sidewalk Infrastructure</h4><p>There are no sidewalks anywhere in Berlin. Residents walking for exercise, to visit neighbors, or to check mail must use the roadway itself.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">3</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Farm Equipment Blocking Visibility</h4><p>Tractors, combines, and other agricultural equipment sharing narrow roads force pedestrians into ditches and block drivers' views of people on foot.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">4</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>No Street Lighting</h4><p>Most Berlin roads are completely unlit after sunset. Pedestrians become invisible to drivers, especially on overcast evenings.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">5</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Excessive Speed on County Roads</h4><p>Drivers treat rural county roads like highways, reaching speeds far above what is safe for roads shared with pedestrians and farm equipment.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">6</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>No Crossings or Warning Signs</h4><p>Berlin has no marked crosswalks, no pedestrian crossing signs, and no traffic signals of any kind. Drivers receive zero warning that pedestrians may be ahead.</p></div></li>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Alabama Pedestrian Law</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Know Your Rights as a Pedestrian in Alabama</h2>
  <div class="ff-law-box"><h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3><ul>
    <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
    <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
    <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
    <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
    <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
    <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
    <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
    <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
    <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
    <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="ff-callout"><p><strong>No sidewalk doesn't mean no rights.</strong> Insurance companies will blame you for walking on a road without a sidewalk. But when there is no alternative infrastructure, Alabama law still requires drivers to exercise due care. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to fight this argument.</p></div>

  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Berlin</h2>
  <ol class="ff-steps">
    <li><div><h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4><p>Call 911. Rural response times in Berlin may be longer. The Cullman County Sheriff and county EMS will respond. An official police report is critical evidence.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4><p>Get checked at Cullman Regional Medical Center even if injuries seem minor. Rural road impacts at speed cause serious internal injuries that may not appear for hours.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Document Everything</h4><p>Photograph the scene, road conditions, lack of shoulders and lighting, your injuries, and the vehicle. Document the infrastructure failures that contributed to the accident.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4><p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements to twist against you under Alabama's contributory negligence rule. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson</h4><p>The sooner we are involved, the better we can preserve evidence and protect your claim. Free consultation &mdash; call (256) 350-7200.</p></div></li>

  <div class="ff-faq">
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was walking on a rural road with no sidewalk in Berlin?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. The absence of sidewalks does not make walking negligent. When there is no sidewalk or alternative pedestrian path, Alabama law still requires drivers to exercise <strong>due care</strong> to avoid hitting pedestrians (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213). Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to prove that infrastructure failures &mdash; not your decision to walk &mdash; contributed to the accident.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What makes Berlin's rural roads so dangerous for pedestrians?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Berlin's county roads have no sidewalks, no paved shoulders, no street lighting, and no crosswalks. Roads end abruptly at ditches, leaving pedestrians with inches of space between themselves and passing vehicles. Add farm equipment blocking visibility and drivers treating county roads like highways, and you have conditions that are uniquely dangerous for anyone on foot.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Who responds to pedestrian accidents in Berlin?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>The Cullman County Sheriff's Office and county EMS respond to accidents in Berlin. Rural response times can be longer than in town, making it critical to call 911 immediately. An official police report is essential evidence for your claim.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What compensation can I recover after a pedestrian accident on a Berlin county road?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>You may recover compensation for current and future medical bills, lost wages and earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability, and loss of quality of life. Rural road impacts at speed often cause severe injuries requiring long-term treatment and rehabilitation.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence law affect my case?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong>, meaning if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim could be denied. They'll argue you shouldn't have been walking on a road without a sidewalk. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson defeats these arguments by proving the driver's negligence was the sole cause.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson charge upfront fees?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong> &mdash; you pay nothing unless we win your case. Your consultation is free, and there are no hourly charges or upfront costs.</p></div></details>
