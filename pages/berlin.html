                    <h2>Walking on Berlin's County Roads Shouldn't Cost You Everything</h2>
                    <p>Berlin doesn't have sidewalks. It doesn't have street lights on most roads. It doesn't have shoulders wide enough to walk on safely. But people still need to walk — to check the mail, visit a neighbor, get exercise, or tend to property along the road.</p>
                    <p>When drivers speed through these narrow rural roads without watching for pedestrians, or when farm equipment forces walkers into the traffic lane, the results are catastrophic. You can't step out of the way when there's a ditch on one side and a speeding truck on the other.</p>
                    <p><strong>If you were hit while walking on a Berlin road, you deserve compensation for medical bills, lost wages, and the pain this has caused.</strong> Ferguson & Ferguson fights for rural Alabamians who were injured through no fault of their own.</p>

                        <p>Most Berlin roads have pavement that ends abruptly at a ditch or grass. There's no buffer zone. When a vehicle approaches, pedestrians have no safe place to step aside — forcing them to either walk in the traffic lane or risk the uneven ground along the edge.</p>

                        <p>Berlin has zero dedicated pedestrian infrastructure. No sidewalks. No walking paths. No crosswalks. People walk on the road because there's nowhere else to walk — and drivers don't always expect to see someone on foot around the next curve.</p>

                        <p>Tractors, combines, and other agricultural machinery share Berlin's roads with cars and pedestrians. When a wide tractor approaches, pedestrians are pushed into the grass or ditch — and drivers coming from behind may not see the person on foot until it's too late.</p>

                <h3>Contributory Negligence Rule</h3>
                <p>Alabama follows a strict contributory negligence rule. If you were even 1% at fault for the accident, you cannot recover compensation — even if the driver was 99% at fault. Insurance companies will use this law to blame you for walking on a road with no sidewalks. <strong>We fight back by proving the driver's negligence was the sole cause of your injuries.</strong></p>

                <h3>Pedestrian Right-of-Way (Ala. Code § 32-5A-214 - 221)</h3>
                <p>Alabama law requires drivers to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks and to exercise due care to avoid hitting pedestrians on the road. Even on rural roads without marked crossings, drivers must watch for people on foot and take reasonable precautions to avoid collisions.</p>
