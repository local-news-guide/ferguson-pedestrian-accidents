        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Downtown Cullman's Streets Are Dangerous for Pedestrians</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">With a population of nearly 17,000, Cullman is the commercial and cultural hub of Cullman County. Its downtown district draws shoppers, diners, and families to First Avenue and surrounding streets — the same streets where distracted and speeding drivers create serious hazards for people on foot.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">The intersection of US-278 and US-31 channels thousands of vehicles through town daily. Add school zones around Cullman City Schools, pedestrians walking to Cullman Regional Medical Center, and evening foot traffic near restaurants and businesses, and you have a recipe for devastating accidents.</p>
        <p>At Ferguson &amp; Ferguson, we've represented pedestrians struck at some of Cullman's most dangerous intersections. We know these roads. We know the patterns. And we know how to build a case that holds negligent drivers accountable.</p>

          <h4>Distracted Driving on First Avenue</h4>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Contributory negligence is Alabama's biggest trap.</strong> Insurance adjusters will look for any reason — jaywalking, wearing dark clothing, being distracted by your phone — to argue you share fault. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson knows how to dismantle these arguments and protect your claim.</p>

      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4>
          <p>Get medical help and create an official police report. This is critical evidence. Cullman Police Department or the Cullman County Sheriff will respond and document the scene.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4>
          <p>Even if you feel okay, get checked at Cullman Regional Medical Center or your doctor. Internal injuries from pedestrian impacts often don't show symptoms for hours or days.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document Everything</h4>
          <p>Photograph the scene, your injuries, the vehicle, the crosswalk or intersection, traffic signals, and any skid marks. Get contact info from witnesses.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They're looking for statements they can twist against you. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson</h4>
          <p>The sooner we're involved, the better we can preserve evidence, interview witnesses, and protect your claim from the insurance company's tactics.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What should I do immediately after a pedestrian accident in Cullman?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Call 911 first. Cullman Police Department or the Cullman County Sheriff will respond and create an official accident report. Seek medical attention at Cullman Regional Medical Center even if you feel fine &mdash; many pedestrian injuries, like internal bleeding or traumatic brain injury, don't show symptoms right away. Document the scene with photos, get witness contact info, and do not give the insurance company a recorded statement before speaking with an attorney.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence law affect my pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only a few states that follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong>. This means if the insurance company can prove you were even 1% at fault for the accident &mdash; jaywalking, wearing dark clothing at night, looking at your phone &mdash; they can deny your entire claim. This makes it critical to have an experienced attorney who can defeat these arguments and protect your right to compensation.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Where do most pedestrian accidents happen in Cullman?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>The most dangerous areas for pedestrians in Cullman include the US-278 and US-31 intersection, First Avenue in the downtown district, school zones near Cullman City Schools, the area around Cullman Regional Medical Center, and restaurant and shopping districts along Second Avenue. These high-traffic corridors see the most pedestrian-vehicle conflicts.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What types of compensation can I recover after a pedestrian accident?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Pedestrian accident victims can recover compensation for medical bills (current and future), lost wages and lost earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability or disfigurement, and loss of quality of life. In cases involving extreme negligence, punitive damages may also be available. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson calculates the full value of your claim, not just your current medical bills.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident. If you miss this deadline, you lose your right to file a lawsuit. However, building a strong case takes time &mdash; preserving evidence, obtaining police reports, and documenting your injuries. We recommend contacting an attorney as soon as possible after the accident.</p>

          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we don't recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
