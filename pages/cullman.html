        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Cullman's Growth Has Outpaced Its Pedestrian Infrastructure</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Cullman sits at the crossroads of US-31 and US-278 &mdash; two federal highways that funnel regional traffic directly through the heart of a city that was never designed for the volume it now carries. With a population approaching 17,000 and steady commercial expansion along the US-31 corridor, the gap between driver speed and pedestrian safety is growing wider every year.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">The historic Warehouse District, the L&amp;N Railroad corridor, Cullman Regional Medical Center, school zones around Cullman City Schools, and the big-box retail clusters along Highway 157 all generate pedestrian traffic in areas where drivers aren't expecting it. When a 4,000-pound vehicle meets a person on foot, the physics are devastating.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows these intersections, these sight-line problems, and these insurance company tactics &mdash; because he's built cases around them before.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes the City of Cullman, unincorporated areas along US-31 and US-278, and all 12 communities in our Cullman County service network. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 35 minutes north via I-65.</p>

          <h4>US-31 / US-278 Interchange &mdash; The County's Busiest Intersection</h4>
          <p>These two federal highways cross in central Cullman, funneling regional commuter, commercial, and through-traffic into a concentrated zone. Drivers transitioning from 55 mph highway speed to 35 mph city speed regularly misjudge stopping distances. Pedestrians crossing at this interchange face vehicles from four approach angles, including turning trucks from the US-278 commercial corridor.</p>

          <h4>L&amp;N Railroad Corridor &mdash; The East-West Barrier</h4>
          <p>The historic Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad bisects Cullman roughly north-south. Grade crossings at First Avenue, Second Avenue, and Clark Street force both drivers and pedestrians into compressed crossing windows. When trains block crossings, drivers re-route onto secondary streets &mdash; streets where pedestrians are walking but no crosswalks exist.</p>

          <h4>Warehouse District &mdash; Commercial-to-Residential Transitions</h4>
          <p>Cullman's downtown Warehouse District has evolved from industrial use to mixed commercial, dining, and event space. Pedestrian foot traffic has increased dramatically, but the street geometry &mdash; wide lanes, limited sidewalks, and industrial-era curb cuts &mdash; still prioritizes truck and vehicle movement. Evening events draw crowds into roadways with no dedicated pedestrian paths.</p>

Parking lot entrances and exits create dozens of conflict points where turning vehicles cross pedestrian paths. Many of these access roads lack crosswalks, sidewalks, or any pedestrian signage.</p>

Drop-off and pickup queues extend into adjacent streets, creating congestion where distracted drivers and walking children share space simultaneously. Reduced speed zones are frequently violated, particularly along 2nd Avenue near Cullman Middle School.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Cullman Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Cullman pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters commonly argue that the pedestrian was jaywalking, wearing dark clothing, distracted by a phone, or crossed outside a marked crosswalk. At complex intersections like US-278 and US-31, they may claim the pedestrian entered the roadway against a signal &mdash; even when signal timing and crosswalk geometry make safe crossing nearly impossible within the allotted walk phase.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Cullman intersection geometry matters.</strong> At the US-278/US-31 interchange, crosswalk distances exceed 60 feet in some directions. Walk-phase timing may not account for elderly pedestrians, parents with strollers, or anyone moving slower than 3.5 ft/sec. Randy Ferguson uses signal timing data, crosswalk surveys, and intersection geometry to dismantle contributory negligence arguments that insurance companies rely on.</p>

For accidents outside city limits in unincorporated Cullman County, the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>.

          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Pedestrian impacts commonly cause traumatic brain injuries, internal bleeding, and spinal injuries that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records created immediately after the accident become key evidence in your claim.</p>

        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the intersection, crosswalk markings, traffic signals, the vehicle, your injuries, any skid marks, and sight-line obstructions. Get contact information from witnesses. Note the time, weather, and lighting conditions. If there's a nearby traffic camera or business security camera, note its location.</p>

      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. Their goal is to get you on the record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Cullman's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Cullman's location in the foothills of the Appalachian Plateau &mdash; at approximately 800 feet elevation &mdash; produces weather patterns that directly affect pedestrian visibility and driver stopping distances.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>Morning Fog &mdash; October Through March</h4>
          <p>Cullman's valley terrain traps cold air overnight, producing dense ground-level fog that reduces visibility to under 200 feet during morning commute hours. Pedestrians walking to schools, bus stops, or work along US-31 and residential side streets become invisible to drivers until it's too late to stop. Morning fog accidents peak between 6:30 AM and 8:00 AM.</p>

          <h4>Seasonal Sun Glare &mdash; US-278 East-West Alignment</h4>
          <p>US-278 runs roughly east-west through Cullman. During spring and fall equinox periods, low-angle sun creates severe windshield glare during both morning and evening commutes. Drivers heading east on US-278 in the morning and west in the evening face direct sun at the exact hours when pedestrian traffic is highest. Intersection crosswalks at US-278 and US-31, and US-278 and Highway 69, are particularly affected.</p>

          <h4>Afternoon Thunderstorms &mdash; May Through September</h4>
          <p>North Alabama's convective storm season produces sudden, heavy downpours that reduce visibility and make road surfaces slick within minutes. Pedestrians caught without shelter may rush across intersections. Drivers on wet roads at 35+ mph need significantly longer stopping distances. Standing water at Cullman's low-lying intersections near the railroad corridor compounds braking problems.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Where do I get a copy of my Cullman pedestrian accident police report?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>If the <strong>Cullman Police Department</strong> responded, request your report from CPD at 510 2nd Avenue SW, Cullman, AL 35055, or call <a href="tel:+12567341434">(256) 734-1434</a>. If the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responded (for accidents outside city limits), contact the Sheriff's Office at <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. Most reports are available within 5&ndash;10 business days. Your attorney can also obtain the report on your behalf.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was hit in a parking lot in Cullman?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. Parking lot accidents in Cullman &mdash; including lots near Walmart, Cullman Shopping Center, and downtown businesses &mdash; are among the most common pedestrian accident locations. While parking lots are private property, Alabama traffic negligence laws still apply. Drivers owe pedestrians a duty of care whether on a public road or a private lot. Contact Ferguson &amp; Ferguson to discuss the specifics of your parking lot accident.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Cullman pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. This means if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault &mdash; jaywalking, wearing dark clothing, looking at your phone &mdash; your entire claim can be denied. At Cullman intersections like US-278 and US-31, insurance companies often argue pedestrians contributed by crossing outside a marked crosswalk. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments using crosswalk surveys, signal timing data, and scene evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What types of compensation can I recover after a pedestrian accident in Cullman?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Pedestrian accident victims in Cullman can recover compensation for current and future medical bills, lost wages and lost earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability or disfigurement, and loss of quality of life. In cases involving extreme negligence &mdash; like a DUI driver or someone texting while driving &mdash; punitive damages may also be available. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson calculates the full long-term value of your claim.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident (Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38). If you miss this deadline, you lose your right to file a lawsuit entirely. However, building a strong case &mdash; preserving evidence, obtaining police reports, and documenting your full medical treatment &mdash; takes time. We recommend contacting an attorney as soon as possible after the accident.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson charge upfront fees for Cullman pedestrian accident cases?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
