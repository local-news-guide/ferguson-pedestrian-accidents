        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">A Flat, Straight Highway Where Drivers See No Reason to Slow Down</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">South Vinemont is an unincorporated community of approximately 700 people strung along US-31 in northern Cullman County. The terrain is flat, the road is straight, and the sight lines extend for miles &mdash; which sounds like it should make pedestrians safer. Instead, it makes things worse. Drivers on flat, straight US-31 see open road ahead and accelerate, maintaining 55+ mph through a residential corridor where people live, walk, and work.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Cullman Regional Airport (Folsom Field) sits adjacent to the community, generating additional vehicle traffic that intersects with US-31. The airport area and surrounding businesses have no pedestrian infrastructure connecting them to South Vinemont's residential areas. Workers, residents, and visitors walk along US-31's road edge to reach everything from the nearest store to a neighbor's driveway.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows how South Vinemont's flat terrain, high-speed corridor, and absent infrastructure create pedestrian dangers that insurance companies minimize.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes South Vinemont, the US-31 corridor through northern Cullman County, the Cullman Regional Airport area, and all surrounding unincorporated areas.

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Understanding South Vinemont's Street-Level Risk</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Every pedestrian accident in South Vinemont happens at a specific place, shaped by the corridor's flat, open geometry. Understanding why straight roads are paradoxically more dangerous helps explain the accident patterns here.</p>

          <h4>US-31 Straight Corridor &mdash; The Speed Illusion</h4>
          <p>US-31 through South Vinemont is flat and straight for extended stretches. This geometry encourages drivers to maintain or exceed highway speed because they perceive no obstacles ahead. But homes, driveways, and residential activity line both sides of the road. Pedestrians walking along the shoulder or crossing to a neighbor's home face vehicles traveling at speeds designed for open highway, not a residential community.</p>

          <p>The airport and its associated businesses generate vehicle traffic that enters and exits US-31 at access points near South Vinemont. Drivers focused on airport navigation make turns onto US-31 without scanning for pedestrians. The airport area has no sidewalks, no pedestrian crossings, and no lighting connecting it to the residential community just feet away.</p>

          <h4>Scattered Residential Properties &mdash; Driveways as Crossing Points</h4>
          <p>South Vinemont's homes are scattered along US-31 and county roads, with each driveway serving as a pedestrian crossing point. Residents checking mail, walking to a neighbor, or taking children to a bus stop must cross or walk along a highway where drivers are traveling at 55+ mph. Every driveway is an unprotected conflict zone.</p>

          <h4>County Road Intersections &mdash; Uncontrolled Crossroads</h4>
          <p>Several county roads intersect US-31 in the South Vinemont area, controlled only by stop signs. Drivers approaching these intersections from county roads focus on merging with highway traffic and fail to check for pedestrians. Pedestrians walking along US-31 who pass these intersections face turning vehicles from unexpected angles.</p>

          <p>South Vinemont's flat, open terrain offers no natural buffer between the road and the surrounding landscape. Unlike tree-lined or hilly areas where vegetation and terrain create some separation, South Vinemont's pedestrians walk fully exposed to wind, weather, and high-speed traffic with nothing between them and the travel lane but a few feet of gravel shoulder.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your South Vinemont Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In South Vinemont pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters commonly argue that the pedestrian shouldn't have been walking along US-31, should have worn reflective clothing at night, or should have crossed at a different time. They ignore the reality that South Vinemont has no sidewalks, no crosswalks, and no alternative paths &mdash; walking along US-31 is the only option for residents who need to get somewhere on foot.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Walking at night is not negligence.</strong> Insurance companies will blame you for walking after dark or wearing dark clothing. Alabama law requires drivers to use headlights and exercise due care at all times, including after dark. The absence of street lighting on US-31 through South Vinemont is an infrastructure failure, not a reason to deny your claim. Randy Ferguson defeats these victim-blaming tactics by proving the driver failed their legal duty.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">After an Accident</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in South Vinemont</h2>
    <ol class="ff-steps">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call 911 &mdash; Cullman County Sheriff</h4>
          <p>South Vinemont is unincorporated Cullman County, so the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a> or dial 911. For US-31 accidents, Alabama State Troopers may also respond. If the accident happened at night, stress urgency &mdash; response times in dark rural areas can be longer. An official accident report is critical evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Highway-speed pedestrian impacts cause traumatic brain injuries, spinal damage, and internal bleeding that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records become key evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the road, lighting conditions (or lack thereof), road shoulders, your injuries, and the vehicle. Use your phone flash to document how little visibility exists at night. Note the distance from your location to the nearest crosswalk or sidewalk &mdash; the answer is almost certainly "there isn't one."</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">South Vinemont's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">South Vinemont's flat, open terrain along US-31 creates weather exposure patterns that compound the corridor's existing speed and visibility challenges. The absence of windbreaks and the open agricultural landscape amplify seasonal hazards.</p>

          <h4>Road Spray on Wet Days &mdash; Year-Round</h4>
          <p>US-31's flat, straight profile allows vehicles to maintain high speed even in rain. Passing trucks and cars at 55+ mph throw sheets of road spray that temporarily blind following drivers and drench pedestrians on the shoulder. A pedestrian walking along US-31 in rain becomes invisible for 2&ndash;3 seconds each time a vehicle passes &mdash; and the next vehicle in line may not see them at all through the spray curtain.</p>

          <h4>Open-Field Wind Gusts &mdash; November Through March</h4>
          <p>South Vinemont's flat terrain and open agricultural fields allow wind to accelerate across the landscape without obstruction. Pedestrians walking along US-31 face sustained wind gusts that push them off the shoulder and toward the travel lane. Winter wind chill makes pedestrians rush rather than wait for safe crossing opportunities, reducing their attention to approaching traffic.</p>

          <h4>Sun Glare on North-South Alignment &mdash; Morning and Evening</h4>
          <p>US-31 runs roughly north-south through South Vinemont. During early morning and late afternoon hours, low-angle sun creates severe windshield glare for drivers heading toward the sun. This glare effect is amplified by South Vinemont's flat terrain, which offers no shadow relief. Pedestrians walking on the road shoulder face drivers who are effectively sun-blinded during the exact hours when commuter traffic is heaviest.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Who responds to pedestrian accidents in South Vinemont?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>South Vinemont is an unincorporated community in Cullman County, so the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds to accidents. Call 911 or contact the Sheriff directly at <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. For US-31 accidents, Alabama State Troopers may also respond. Request an official accident report &mdash; it is critical evidence for your claim.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Cullman Regional Airport (Folsom Field) affect pedestrian safety in South Vinemont?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>The airport and its associated businesses generate vehicle traffic that enters US-31 near South Vinemont. Airport-related vehicles making turns onto US-31 focus on highway traffic gaps and may fail to check for pedestrians. The airport area also lacks pedestrian infrastructure connecting it to nearby residential areas, forcing workers and visitors to walk along US-31 without sidewalks.</p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my South Vinemont pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. If the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim can be denied. In South Vinemont, insurance adjusters commonly argue pedestrians shouldn't have been walking along US-31 or should have worn reflective clothing at night. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments by proving the driver's negligence and the absence of pedestrian alternatives.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What types of compensation can I recover after a pedestrian accident in South Vinemont?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Pedestrian accident victims can recover compensation for current and future medical bills, lost wages and lost earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability or disfigurement, and loss of quality of life. Highway-speed pedestrian impacts on US-31 tend to cause severe injuries with long recovery periods, which increases the total value of your claim.</p>

      </details>
      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident (Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38). However, evidence deteriorates quickly &mdash; skid marks fade, surveillance footage gets overwritten, and witnesses move away. Contact an attorney as soon as possible after the accident.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson charge upfront fees for South Vinemont pedestrian accident cases?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
