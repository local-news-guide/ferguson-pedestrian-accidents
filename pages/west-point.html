        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Blind Curves and Zero Pedestrian Infrastructure Define West Point's Roads</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">West Point is an unincorporated community in western Cullman County situated along AL-157 &mdash; a state highway that twists through rolling terrain with sweeping curves that limit visibility to a few hundred feet in either direction. With a population of roughly 500 people, West Point has no municipal services, no traffic signals, no sidewalks, and no marked crosswalks anywhere in the community.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Residents who walk to neighboring homes, to the post office, to West Point High School, or along the shoulder of AL-157 share road space with vehicles traveling at highway speeds around blind curves. Drivers rounding these curves at 45&ndash;55 mph have less than three seconds of reaction time when a pedestrian appears ahead. That gap between discovery and impact is where catastrophic pedestrian injuries happen.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He understands how curve geometry, limited sight lines, and the total absence of pedestrian infrastructure combine to create the conditions that lead to West Point's pedestrian accidents.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes West Point, Dodge City, Cullman, Good Hope, South Vinemont, and all 12 communities in our Cullman County service network.

          <h4>AL-157 Curve Corridor &mdash; The Community's Spine and Greatest Hazard</h4>
          <p>AL-157 is the primary road through West Point, carrying commuter traffic between the I-65 corridor and communities to the west. The highway follows rolling terrain with multiple sweeping curves that limit forward visibility to 200&ndash;300 feet. Drivers maintain 45&ndash;55 mph speeds through these curves &mdash; speeds that leave less than 3 seconds of reaction time when a pedestrian appears ahead. With no shoulders, no sidewalks, and no reflective markers, pedestrians walking along AL-157 are functionally invisible until a driver rounds the curve.</p>

          <h4>West Point High School Zone &mdash; Foot Traffic Meets Highway Speed</h4>
          <p>West Point High School sits along AL-157, generating concentrated pedestrian traffic during morning arrival (7:00&ndash;7:45 AM) and afternoon dismissal (2:30&ndash;3:15 PM). Students walking to and from school, crossing AL-157, and congregating near the school entrance share road space with through-traffic that often fails to slow for the reduced speed zone. Drop-off and pickup queues extend onto AL-157, creating congestion where distracted parents and walking students occupy the same space.</p>

          <h4>County Road Intersections &mdash; Uncontrolled Crossing Points</h4>
          <p>Several county roads feed into AL-157 at West Point, creating T-intersections governed only by stop signs on the minor roads. Pedestrians crossing AL-157 at these intersections have no crosswalks, no signals, and no refuge islands. Drivers turning from county roads onto AL-157 focus on merging with highway-speed traffic and fail to scan for people on foot. Drivers on AL-157 approaching these intersections focus on turning vehicles and miss pedestrians standing at the road edge.</p>

          <h4>Residential Driveway Zones &mdash; Hidden Exit Points</h4>
          <p>West Point's homes are spread along AL-157 and connecting county roads, with individual driveways that open directly onto the highway. Residents checking mailboxes, walking to vehicles, or crossing from one side of their property to the other must cross or enter the travel lane. Vegetation and terrain at many driveways block sight lines in both directions. Drivers rounding curves at highway speed encounter pedestrians stepping out of driveways with no warning.</p>

          <h4>Rural Walking Routes &mdash; No Alternative Exists</h4>
          <p>West Point has no sidewalks, no multi-use paths, and no separated pedestrian routes of any kind. Residents who walk for exercise, to visit neighbors, or to reach destinations within the community have exactly one option: the road itself. On AL-157, that means walking on or immediately adjacent to a travel lane carrying 55 mph traffic around blind curves. On county roads, shoulders are often gravel or nonexistent, pushing walkers into the lane.</p>

          <p>Drivers rounding AL-157's sweeping curves at highway speed discover pedestrians walking on the shoulder or in the travel lane with less than 3 seconds of reaction time. At 55 mph, the vehicle covers 80 feet per second &mdash; closing a 240-foot gap before most drivers can even move their foot to the brake. These are high-speed impacts with devastating injury patterns.</p>

Pedestrians walking after dark are completely invisible to approaching drivers until headlight illumination reaches them &mdash; typically at 200&ndash;250 feet. At highway speeds, that distance provides roughly 2.5 seconds of reaction time. Pedestrians in dark clothing on unlit roads face extreme risk.</p>

          <h4>Passing-Vehicle Pedestrian Strikes</h4>
          <p>On AL-157's two-lane sections, faster vehicles pass slower traffic by crossing into the oncoming lane. Pedestrians walking on the opposite shoulder are struck by passing vehicles that swing wide around curves or misjudge the space needed. These are head-on impacts at combined closing speeds that produce the most severe injuries.</p>

<!-- Fault Evaluation -->
<section id="fault" class="ff-section ff-section--gray">
  <div class="ff-container--narrow">
    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your West Point Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In West Point pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters commonly argue that the pedestrian should not have been walking on AL-157 at all, should have worn reflective clothing, or should have walked on the opposite side of the road. They use the rural setting to shift blame onto the victim &mdash; even though no sidewalks, crosswalks, or alternative pedestrian routes exist anywhere in West Point.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>West Point's curve geometry is your strongest evidence.</strong> When a two-lane highway sends vehicles around blind curves at 55 mph with zero pedestrian infrastructure, the responsibility shifts to the driver to operate at a speed that allows them to stop within their sight distance. Randy Ferguson uses ALDOT road geometry data, curve radius measurements, and sight-line analysis to prove that drivers on AL-157 were operating too fast for conditions &mdash; regardless of what the pedestrian was doing.</p>

          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Pedestrian impacts on AL-157 involve highway-speed vehicles and commonly cause traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, and multiple fractures. Medical records created immediately after the accident become key evidence in your claim.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the curve, your position on the road, the sight lines from both directions, the absence of shoulders or sidewalks, the vehicle, your injuries, and any skid marks. Note the time, weather, and lighting conditions. If possible, photograph the road from the driver's approach angle to show what they could or could not have seen.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. In West Point cases, they will focus on why you were walking on AL-157 &mdash; trying to establish contributory negligence. Politely decline any recorded statement and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

          <p>The sooner we're involved, the better we can preserve evidence, measure sight lines before conditions change, interview witnesses while memories are fresh, and protect your claim from insurance tactics designed to blame the pedestrian for walking on a road with no alternative.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">West Point's Terrain Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">West Point's rolling terrain and wooded curves along AL-157 produce localized weather conditions that directly reduce pedestrian visibility and driver stopping ability at the worst possible moments.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>Curve-Pocket Fog &mdash; October Through March</h4>
          <p>West Point's rolling terrain traps cold air in low-lying sections of AL-157, producing dense fog that pools in curve pockets where visibility drops below 150 feet. A driver rounding a curve at 55 mph into a fog pocket cannot see a pedestrian until they are 1.5&ndash;2 seconds away. These curve-pocket fog conditions are most dangerous between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM during the fall and winter school commute.</p>

          <h4>Pop-Up Thunderstorms &mdash; May Through September</h4>
          <p>North Alabama's convective storm season produces sudden, intense downpours that reduce visibility to near-zero within seconds. On AL-157's curves, rain-blinded drivers lose the ability to track road geometry and pedestrian position simultaneously. Standing water at low points in the curve corridor increases stopping distances by 30&ndash;50%. Pedestrians caught in sudden storms have nowhere to shelter along the roadside.</p>

          <h4>Curve-Exit Sun Glare &mdash; Morning and Evening Year-Round</h4>
          <p>AL-157's curving alignment means drivers exiting certain curves face direct sun at specific times of day. Morning sun blinds eastbound drivers; evening sun blinds westbound drivers. The transition from shaded, tree-canopied curves into sudden direct sunlight produces a 2&ndash;4 second adaptation gap where the driver effectively cannot see the road ahead. Pedestrians standing or walking in these sun-strike zones are invisible during the glare window.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What makes AL-157 through West Point so dangerous for pedestrians?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>AL-157 runs through West Point with sweeping curves that limit driver sight lines to 200&ndash;300 feet in several sections. Drivers maintaining 45&ndash;55 mph speeds on these curves cannot see pedestrians until they are dangerously close. The road has no sidewalks, no crosswalks, and narrow or nonexistent shoulders, forcing pedestrians to walk in or immediately adjacent to the travel lane.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Who responds to a pedestrian accident in West Point?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>West Point is an unincorporated area of Cullman County with no municipal police department. The <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds to all accidents in West Point &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a> or dial 911. An official accident report from the Sheriff's Office is critical evidence for your pedestrian accident claim.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if I was hit while walking near West Point High School?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. School zone accidents are among the most clear-cut cases of driver negligence. Drivers who speed through the West Point High School zone, fail to yield during arrival and dismissal hours, or pass stopped school buses violate Alabama traffic law. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson documents school zone conditions, speed data, and crossing patterns to build strong pedestrian injury claims.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my West Point pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. If the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim can be denied. In West Point, insurers commonly argue pedestrians should not have been walking on AL-157 at all &mdash; even though no sidewalks or alternative routes exist. Attorney Randy Ferguson counters these arguments using road geometry data, the absence of pedestrian infrastructure, and the driver's speed relative to sight-line limitations.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">What compensation can I recover after a pedestrian accident in West Point?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Pedestrian accident victims in West Point can recover compensation for current and future medical bills, lost wages and lost earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability or disfigurement, and loss of quality of life. In cases involving extreme negligence &mdash; like distracted driving on a blind curve &mdash; punitive damages may also be available.

        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
