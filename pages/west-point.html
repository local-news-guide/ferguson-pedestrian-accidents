  <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Dangerous Crossroads in a Rural Community</h2>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">West Point is a small Cullman County community of about 500 people situated where several county roads converge. These intersections &mdash; governed by stop signs rather than traffic signals &mdash; create particular hazards for pedestrians. Turning vehicles focus on merging with cross-traffic and frequently fail to check for people on foot.</p>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Agricultural activity adds another dimension. Farm equipment approaching intersections blocks visibility for both pedestrians and drivers. Tractors making wide turns at crossroads can push pedestrians off the road or into the path of oncoming vehicles.</p>
  <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents pedestrians injured at West Point's intersections and along its county roads. We understand how uncontrolled crossroads, agricultural traffic, and poor sight lines combine to create deadly conditions.</p>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Alabama Pedestrian Law</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Know Your Rights as a Pedestrian in Alabama</h2>
  <div class="ff-law-box"><h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3><ul>
    <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
    <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
    <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
    <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
    <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
    <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
    <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
    <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
    <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
    <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="ff-callout"><p><strong>Stop signs protect vehicles, not pedestrians.</strong> Uncontrolled intersections give pedestrians zero protection. Drivers owe a duty of care to watch for people on foot at every intersection. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson holds them to that standard.</p></div>

  <ol class="ff-steps">
    <li><div><h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4><p>Call 911. The Cullman County Sheriff will respond. Make sure a police report documents the intersection, traffic control, and conditions.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4><p>Go to Cullman Regional Medical Center. Intersection impacts involve turning vehicles that can cause complex injuries.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Document Everything</h4><p>Photograph the intersection, sight lines, stop signs, vegetation blocking views, your injuries, and the vehicle. Document where you were when struck.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4><p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements to twist against you under Alabama's contributory negligence rule. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p></div></li>

<section id="faq" class="ff-section"><div class="ff-container"><div class="ff-text-center ff-mb-5"><span class="ff-eyebrow">Frequently Asked Questions</span><h2>Pedestrian Accident FAQ &mdash; West Point, Alabama</h2></div>
  <div class="ff-faq">
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What makes West Point's intersections so dangerous for pedestrians?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>West Point sits where several county roads converge. These intersections use stop signs rather than traffic signals, meaning drivers must self-regulate their speed and attention. Turning vehicles focus on merging with cross-traffic and frequently fail to check for pedestrians. Poor sight lines from vegetation and terrain make it even worse.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">I was struck by a farm vehicle turning at a West Point intersection. Can I file a claim?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Agricultural vehicle operators owe the same duty of care to pedestrians as any other driver. Farm equipment making wide turns at intersections can push pedestrians off the road or into the path of oncoming traffic. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson handles accidents involving agricultural vehicles and understands the unique liability issues involved.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How does poor visibility at intersections affect my pedestrian accident case?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Poor sight lines caused by vegetation, terrain, or parked equipment can actually strengthen your case. If the driver couldn't see pedestrians at an intersection, they had a duty to approach with extra caution and reduced speed. Failing to do so is negligence. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson documents these conditions to prove the driver's fault.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Alabama's contributory negligence apply at uncontrolled intersections?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Alabama's <strong>contributory negligence</strong> rule applies everywhere. Insurance companies will argue you should have waited for all traffic to clear or crossed at a different location. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson fights these arguments by proving the driver failed their duty of care at the intersection.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What should I do after being struck at a West Point intersection?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Call 911 immediately. The Cullman County Sheriff will respond. Document the intersection with photos &mdash; capture sight lines, stop signs, vegetation blocking views, and any farm equipment. Seek medical attention at Cullman Regional Medical Center. Do not give the insurance company a recorded statement before speaking with an attorney.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How much does it cost to hire Ferguson &amp; Ferguson for my West Point accident?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Nothing upfront. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong> &mdash; you pay nothing unless we win compensation for you. Consultations are always free.</p></div></details>
