        <h2 class="ff-mb-3">A Railroad Town Pinched Between Highway and River</h2>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Garden City is a small town of approximately 500 people in southern Cullman County, pinched between the US-31 highway corridor, the CSX railroad, and the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River. This geographic compression forces all movement &mdash; vehicular and pedestrian &mdash; through a narrow corridor where highway traffic, active railroad crossings, and a bridge bottleneck converge.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">US-31 carries commuter and commercial traffic through town at speeds that don't reflect the residential character of the community. The CSX railroad crossing interrupts traffic flow, creating dangerous acceleration surges after trains pass. The Mulberry Fork bridge narrows the roadway and eliminates any shoulder or escape space for pedestrians.</p>
        <p class="ff-mb-3">Attorney Randy W. Ferguson has represented injured pedestrians across Cullman County for over three decades. He knows how Garden City's compressed geography, railroad crossings, and bridge bottleneck create unique pedestrian dangers.</p>
        <div class="ff-callout">
          <p><strong>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson's Cullman County coverage</strong> includes Garden City, the US-31 corridor through southern Cullman County, the CSX railroad crossing zone, and the Mulberry Fork bridge area. Our office is in Decatur, approximately 50 minutes north via I-65.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Understanding Garden City's Street-Level Risk</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Every pedestrian accident in Garden City happens at a specific place, shaped by the town's compressed geography. Understanding the corridor layout helps explain why certain locations produce more collisions.</p>

          <h4>US-31 Through Town &mdash; Highway Speed in a Residential Zone</h4>
          <p>US-31 runs directly through Garden City, carrying commuter traffic between Cullman and points south at speeds that treat this residential community as open road. The highway was designed as a through-route, not a main street. Pedestrians crossing to reach businesses, the post office, or neighbors on the opposite side face vehicles traveling at 50+ mph with no crosswalks, no pedestrian signals, and limited sight-line distance.</p>

          <h4>CSX Railroad Crossing &mdash; The Acceleration Surge Zone</h4>
          <p>The active CSX railroad crosses US-31 in Garden City. When a train blocks the crossing, traffic queues on both sides. The moment the crossing clears, drivers accelerate aggressively to make up lost time &mdash; creating a surge of fast-moving vehicles through an area where pedestrians may still be crossing or walking near the railroad. The crossing gates and warning systems protect against trains, not the vehicle traffic that follows.</p>

          <h4>Mulberry Fork Bridge &mdash; The No-Escape Bottleneck</h4>
          <p>The Mulberry Fork bridge on US-31 south of Garden City creates a critical bottleneck. The bridge is narrower than the approaching roadway, shoulders disappear entirely, and there is no pedestrian walkway. Anyone walking across or near the bridge &mdash; including fishermen, residents walking to properties on the far side, or stranded motorists &mdash; has zero escape space between traffic and the bridge railing.</p>

          <h4>Garden City Elementary &amp; Residential Core &mdash; Children in the Corridor</h4>
          <p>Garden City's residential area and elementary school sit along the US-31 corridor. Students walking to school, children playing near the road, and families walking to community gatherings all share the highway corridor with through-traffic. The school zone speed reduction is frequently violated by commuters who don't register that they're passing through a town.</p>

          <p>The Mulberry Fork river bottom creates low-lying road sections where US-31 dips before rising to the bridge. These low areas have restricted forward visibility, especially during morning hours. Pedestrians walking along the road edge in river bottom approaches are hidden from drivers until the vehicle is almost upon them.</p>

    <span class="ff-eyebrow">Fault Evaluation</span>
    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Contributory Negligence &amp; How It Affects Your Garden City Claim</h2>
    <p class="ff-mb-3">Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the United States that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. Under this doctrine, if the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault for the accident, your entire claim can be denied &mdash; no matter how seriously you were injured or how reckless the driver was.</p>
    <p class="ff-mb-4">In Garden City pedestrian cases, insurance adjusters commonly argue that the pedestrian should have waited longer after a train cleared, shouldn't have been on the bridge, or should have crossed US-31 at a different location. They ignore the reality that Garden City offers no safe pedestrian alternatives &mdash; no crosswalks, no pedestrian bridge, and no sidewalks connecting the community's two sides.</p>

    <div class="ff-law-box">
      <h3>&#9878; Alabama Pedestrian Statutes That Shape Your Case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
        <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
        <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
        <li>Drivers must yield to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
        <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
        <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges; you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
        <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ff-callout">
      <p><strong>Railroad crossings demand extra caution from drivers.</strong> When a train clears and traffic resumes, drivers know that pedestrians may still be in the crossing area. Accelerating aggressively through a railroad crossing zone is negligent. Randy Ferguson uses traffic pattern evidence, crossing design analysis, and driver speed data to prove that post-train acceleration caused the accident &mdash; not anything the pedestrian did.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Garden City</h2>
    <ol class="ff-steps">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Call 911 &mdash; Garden City PD or Cullman County Sheriff</h4>
          <p>Within Garden City limits, local police may respond. For accidents on US-31 or outside town limits, the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a> or dial 911. For railroad crossing accidents, CSX and federal investigators may also become involved. An official accident report is critical evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Get Medical Attention Immediately</h4>
          <p>Go to <strong>Cullman Regional Medical Center</strong> (1912 AL-157, Cullman) or call an ambulance. Highway-speed pedestrian impacts cause traumatic brain injuries, spinal damage, and internal bleeding that may not show symptoms for hours. Medical records become key evidence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Document the Scene</h4>
          <p>Photograph the railroad crossing, bridge, road width, lack of pedestrian infrastructure, your injuries, and the vehicle. Note whether the railroad crossing gates were active, whether vehicles were accelerating after a train, and any sight-line obstructions in river bottom areas.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4>
          <p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. Their goal is to get you on record saying something they can use to argue contributory negligence. Politely decline and tell them to contact your attorney.</p>

    <h2 class="ff-mb-3">Garden City's Microclimate Creates Seasonal Pedestrian Hazards</h2>
    <p class="ff-lead ff-mb-5">Garden City's location in the Mulberry Fork river valley creates weather patterns that compound the area's existing road geometry challenges. River proximity, low elevation, and the bridge bottleneck all interact with seasonal conditions.</p>
    <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--topo">

        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>River Fog &mdash; October Through March</h4>
          <p>The Mulberry Fork generates dense ground-level fog that blankets the river valley and the US-31 bridge approaches during cool mornings. Visibility can drop below 100 feet near the bridge &mdash; exactly where pedestrians have no escape space. Drivers approaching the bridge in fog may not see a pedestrian on the roadway until they're already on the bridge's narrow span with no room to maneuver.</p>

        <div class="ff-icon-list__text">
          <h4>Bridge Ice &mdash; December Through February</h4>
          <p>Bridges freeze before roadways because cold air circulates above and below the deck. The Mulberry Fork bridge ices over while the approaching road surface remains clear, giving drivers no warning that traction will suddenly change. Pedestrians on or near an icy bridge face vehicles that cannot brake or steer effectively. Even low-speed slides on bridge ice can push a vehicle into a pedestrian trapped against the railing.</p>

          <h4>Afternoon Storm Flooding &mdash; May Through September</h4>
          <p>Summer thunderstorms rapidly raise the Mulberry Fork water level, and the low-lying road approaches south of Garden City can flood. When water covers the road edge, pedestrians are forced further into the travel lane. Drivers encountering standing water may hydroplane or swerve unpredictably. Road spray from passing vehicles reduces pedestrian visibility to near zero.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">Who responds to pedestrian accidents in Garden City?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Within Garden City limits, local police may respond. For accidents on US-31 or outside town limits, the <strong>Cullman County Sheriff's Office</strong> responds &mdash; call <a href="tel:+12567340342">(256) 734-0342</a>. Alabama State Troopers may also respond to US-31 accidents. For railroad crossing incidents, additional federal investigators may become involved. Request an official accident report &mdash; it is critical evidence for your claim.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does the CSX railroad crossing in Garden City affect pedestrian safety?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>The CSX railroad crosses US-31 in Garden City, creating a multi-hazard zone. When trains block the crossing, drivers queue up and then accelerate aggressively when the crossing clears &mdash; creating a surge of fast-moving traffic through an area where pedestrians may be crossing. The crossing gates and warning systems protect against trains, not the vehicle traffic that follows.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence rule affect my Garden City pedestrian accident claim?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama is one of only four jurisdictions in the U.S. that follows <strong>pure contributory negligence</strong>. If the insurance company proves you were even 1% at fault, your entire claim can be denied. In Garden City, insurance adjusters commonly argue pedestrians should have used the railroad crossing differently or waited longer for traffic to clear. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments using crossing design evidence and traffic pattern analysis.</p>

      <details class="ff-faq__item">
        <summary class="ff-faq__q">I was struck near the Mulberry Fork bridge on US-31. Does the bridge affect my case?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Yes. The Mulberry Fork bridge creates a bottleneck where the road narrows and shoulders disappear. Pedestrians on or near the bridge have zero escape space. Drivers are required to exercise heightened care in areas with restricted geometry. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson uses bridge design and road geometry evidence to prove driver negligence in these constrained locations.</p>

        <summary class="ff-faq__q">How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in Alabama?</summary>
        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>Alabama's statute of limitations for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident (Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38). However, evidence deteriorates quickly &mdash; skid marks fade, surveillance footage gets overwritten, and witnesses move away. Contact an attorney as soon as possible after the accident.</p>

        <div class="ff-faq__a">
          <p>No. We work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>, which means you pay nothing unless we win your case. There are no upfront costs, no hourly fees, and no charges if we do not recover compensation for you. Our fee comes from a percentage of the settlement or verdict we secure on your behalf.</p>
