  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Garden City Pedestrian Accidents</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-3">A Growing Town Where Pedestrian Safety Lags Behind</h2>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Garden City is experiencing steady growth that transforms a rural community into a suburban one. With a population around 800 and climbing, more families, more vehicles, and more foot traffic share roads designed for a fraction of today's use.</p>
  <p class="ff-mb-3">Garden City Elementary School is a particular concern. Twice daily, children and parents navigate roads without adequate crosswalks, crossing guards, or reduced-speed enforcement. Drivers who fail to slow in school zones put the community's most vulnerable members at risk.</p>
  <p>Ferguson &amp; Ferguson represents pedestrians injured in Garden City &mdash; from schoolchildren struck in crosswalks to residents hit while walking along roads with no sidewalks.</p>

  <ul class="ff-icon-list ff-icon-list--2col">
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">1</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>School Zone Violations</h4><p>Drivers who speed through Garden City Elementary's school zone or fail to yield to crossing pedestrians endanger children and parents every school day.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">2</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Roads Without Sidewalks</h4><p>Most Garden City streets lack sidewalks. Residents walking to neighbors, the store, or the bus stop must share the road with vehicles.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">3</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Increasing Traffic Volume</h4><p>Population growth has dramatically increased traffic on roads not designed for current volumes, creating more opportunities for pedestrian-vehicle conflicts.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">4</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Speed in Residential Areas</h4><p>Drivers cutting through residential streets often exceed safe speeds, especially on straight sections where they fail to anticipate pedestrians.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">5</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Children Walking Without Protection</h4><p>Without sidewalks or safe walking paths, children walk along road edges to reach school, bus stops, and friends' homes &mdash; a daily risk no family should face.</p></div></li>
    <li><div class="ff-icon-list__icon">6</div><div class="ff-icon-list__text"><h4>Poor Road Design</h4><p>Roads built for rural traffic now serve suburban density. Narrow lanes, missing shoulders, and inadequate sight lines create pedestrian hazards.</p></div></li>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">Alabama Pedestrian Law</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">Know Your Rights as a Pedestrian in Alabama</h2>
  <div class="ff-law-box"><h3>&#9878; Key Alabama Pedestrian Laws</h3><ul>
    <li>Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked and unmarked crosswalks (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-210)</li>
    <li>Pedestrians have the right-of-way at signalized intersections when the walk signal is active</li>
    <li>Drivers must exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian on any roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-213)</li>
    <li>Vehicles stopped at a crosswalk must not be overtaken or passed by other drivers (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-211)</li>
    <li>Drivers must yield the right-of-way to blind pedestrians carrying a white cane or accompanied by a guide dog (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-220)</li>
    <li>If a sidewalk is available, pedestrians must use it rather than the adjacent roadway (Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-215)</li>
    <li>Alabama follows <strong>contributory negligence</strong> &mdash; if you are found even 1% at fault, you could lose your entire claim</li>
    <li>Alabama requires minimum <strong>bodily injury liability coverage</strong> of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident</li>
    <li>Hit-and-run drivers face criminal charges, and you may still recover through uninsured motorist coverage</li>
    <li>The statute of limitations for personal injury in Alabama is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of the accident</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="ff-callout"><p><strong>Children deserve better protection.</strong> When a driver strikes a child in a school zone or on a residential road, the consequences are devastating. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson holds negligent drivers fully accountable.</p></div>

  <span class="ff-eyebrow">After an Accident</span>
  <h2 class="ff-mb-4">What to Do After a Pedestrian Accident in Garden City</h2>
  <ol class="ff-steps">
    <li><div><h4>Call 911 Immediately</h4><p>Call 911. Garden City Police or Cullman County Sheriff will respond. If a child is involved, request EMS immediately regardless of apparent injury severity.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Seek Medical Attention</h4><p>Take your child or yourself to Cullman Regional Medical Center. Children are especially vulnerable to head injuries and internal trauma from pedestrian impacts.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Document Everything</h4><p>Photograph the scene, the vehicle, injuries, road conditions, school zone signage, and any lack of crosswalks. Get contact information from witnesses.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Do Not Give Recorded Statements</h4><p>The driver's insurance company will call quickly. They want statements to twist against you under Alabama's contributory negligence rule. Politely decline and refer them to your attorney.</p></div></li>
    <li><div><h4>Call Ferguson &amp; Ferguson</h4><p>The sooner we are involved, the better we can preserve evidence and protect your claim. Free consultation &mdash; call (256) 350-7200.</p></div></li>

<section id="faq" class="ff-section"><div class="ff-container"><div class="ff-text-center ff-mb-5"><span class="ff-eyebrow">Frequently Asked Questions</span><h2>Pedestrian Accident FAQ &mdash; Garden City, Alabama</h2></div>
  <div class="ff-faq">
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">My child was hit in a school zone near Garden City Elementary. What are our options?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Drivers owe an elevated duty of care in school zones. If a driver was speeding, distracted, or failed to yield to your child in a school zone, they may be liable for all medical costs, pain and suffering, and other damages. Alabama allows parents to file claims on behalf of minor children. Contact Ferguson &amp; Ferguson immediately to protect your family's rights.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What makes Garden City dangerous for pedestrians?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Garden City is growing rapidly, but pedestrian safety infrastructure hasn't kept pace. Most streets lack sidewalks, school zones near Garden City Elementary have limited crossing protections, and increasing traffic volumes on roads designed for rural use create more pedestrian-vehicle conflicts every year.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Can I file a claim if my child was walking to a bus stop and was hit by a car?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Children walking to bus stops are among the most vulnerable pedestrians. Drivers are expected to watch for children near school bus stops, especially in residential areas. When sidewalks don't exist and children must walk along roads, the driver's duty of care is even greater. Ferguson &amp; Ferguson handles school zone and bus stop pedestrian accident cases.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">How does Alabama's contributory negligence law affect a child's pedestrian accident claim?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Alabama courts recognize that <strong>children cannot be held to the same standard as adults</strong> when it comes to contributory negligence. A child's age, experience, and judgment are considered. Young children may not be found contributorily negligent at all. This is a critical legal distinction that can make or break a claim.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">What compensation is available for child pedestrian accident victims?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Compensation may include medical bills (current and future), rehabilitation costs, pain and suffering, emotional trauma, loss of childhood activities, and in severe cases, permanent disability. Parents may also recover damages for their own emotional distress and the cost of caring for an injured child.</p></div></details>
    <details class="ff-faq__item"><summary class="ff-faq__q">Does Ferguson &amp; Ferguson offer free consultations for Garden City accidents?</summary><div class="ff-faq__a"><p>Yes. Your consultation is completely free, and we work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong>. You pay nothing unless we recover compensation for you. This is especially important for families dealing with unexpected medical bills after a child's pedestrian accident.</p></div></details>
